That the city of Naples can prove very delightful,
very amusing, and very instructive for a
week or ten days no one will attempt to dispute.
There are long mornings to be spent in inspecting
the churches scattered throughout the narrow streets
of the old town,—harlequins in coloured marble and
painted stucco though they be, they are yet treasure-houses
containing some of the most precious monuments
of Gothic and Renaissance art that all Italy
can display. There are afternoon hours that can be
passed pleasantly amidst the endless halls and galleries
of the great Museo Nazionale, where the antiquities
of Pompeii and Herculaneum may be studied in
advance, for the wise traveller will not rush headlong
into the sacred precincts of the buried cities on the
Vesuvian shore, before he has first made himself
thoroughly acquainted with the wonderful collections
preserved in the Museum. Then comes the evening
drive along the gentle winding ascent towards Posilipo
with its glorious views over bay and mountains, all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2">[pg 2]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tinged with the deep rose and violet of a Neapolitan
sunset; or the stroll along the fashionable sea front,
named after the luckless Caracciolo the modern hero
of Naples, where in endless succession the carriages
pass backwards and forwards within the limited space
between the sea and the greenery of the Villa Reale.
Or it may be that our more active feet may entice
us to mount the winding flights of stone steps leading
to the heights of Sant’ Elmo, where from the windows
of the monastery of San Martino there is spread out
before us an entrancing view that has but two possible
rivals for extent and interest in all Italy:—the
panorama of the Eternal City from the hill of San
Pietro in Montorio, and that of Florence with the
valley of the Arno from the lofty terrace of San
Miniato. We can while away many hours leisurely in
wandering on the bustling Chiaja or Toledo with
their shops and their amusing scenes of city life, or
in the poorer quarters around the Mercato, where
the inhabitants ply their daily avocations in the open
air, and eat, play, quarrel, flirt, fight or gossip—do
everything in short save go to bed—quite unconcernedly
before the critical and non-admiring eyes
of casual strangers. Pleasant it is to hunt for old
prints, books and other treasures amongst the dark
unwholesome dens that lie in the shadow of the
gorgeous church of Santa Chiara or in the musty-smelling
shops of the curiosity dealers in the Strada
Costantinopoli, picking up here a volume of some
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cinque-cento</span></span> classic and there a piece of old china that
may or may not have had its birth in the famous
factory of Capodimonte. All this studying of historic
sculpture in the churches and of antiquities in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3">[pg 3]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Museum, this observing the daily life of the populace,
and bargain-hunting in the Strada de’ Tribunali,
are agreeable enough for a while, but of necessity
there comes a time when the mind grows weary of
yelling people and of jostling crowds, of stuffy
churches and of the chilly halls of the Museum, of
steep dirty streets and of glaring boulevards, so that
we begin to sigh for fresh air and a change of scene.
Nor is there any means of escape within the precincts
of the city itself from the eternal cracking of whips,
from the insulting compliments (or complimentary
insults) of the incorrigible cabmen, from the continuous
babel of unmusical voices, and from the reiterated
strains of <span class="tei tei-q">“Santa Lucia”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“Margari”</span> howled
from raucous throats or strummed from rickety
street-organs. Oh for peace, and rest, and a whiff
of pure country air! For there are no walks in or
around the City of the Siren, where there is nowhere
to stroll save the narrow strip of the much-vaunted
Villa (which is either damp or dusty according to
weather) or the fatiguing ascent amidst walled gardens
and newly built houses to the heights of the Vomero,
which are covered with a raw suburb. Moreover our
pristine delight in the place is beginning to flag, as
we gradually realise that the city, like the majority
of great modern towns, is being practically rebuilt to
the annihilation of its old-world features, which used
to give to Naples its peculiar charm and its marked
individuality amongst large sea-ports. Long ago
has disappeared Santa Brigida, that picturesque high-coloured
slum, on whose site stands the garish domed
gallery of which the Neapolitans are so proud; gone
in these latter days is classic Santa Lucia with its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4">[pg 4]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>water-gate and its fountain, its vendors of medicated
water and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">frutti di mare</span></span>, those toothsome shell fish of
the unsavoury beach; vanished for ever is many a landmark
of old Naples, and new buildings, streets and
squares, blank, dreary, pretentious and staring, have
arisen in their places. This thorough <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sventramento di
Napoli</span></span>, as the citizens graphically term this drastic
reconstruction of the old capital of the Kingdom of
the Two Sicilies, is no doubt beneficial, not to say
necessary, and we make no protest against these
wholesale changes, which have certainly tended to
destroy utterly its ancient character and appearance.
But all seems commonplace, new, smart, and unpoetic,
and we quickly grow weary of Naples now that it
has been turned into a Liverpool of the South without
the local colour and the peculiar attributes of which
author and artist have so often raved. The life of
the people, picturesque enough in its old setting, now
appears mean and squalid; the toilers in the streets
look jaded, oppressed and discontented; we search
in vain for the spontaneous gaiety of which we have
heard so much. We feel disappointed, cheated even,
in our expectations of Naples, and we begin to understand
that its chief attraction consists in its proximity
to the scenes of beauty that mark the course of its
Riviera.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Riviera of Naples may be said to extend from
the heights of Cumae, at the end of the Bay of Gaeta
to the north, as far as Salerno in a southerly direction,
whilst, lying close to this stretch of shore, are included
the three populous islands of Capri, Procida and
Ischia, which in prehistoric times doubtless formed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5">[pg 5]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>part and parcel of the Parthenopean coast itself.
Our pleasant task it is to write of these classic shores
and islands, where the beauties of nature contend for
pre-eminence with the glorious traditions of the past
that centre round them. What spot on earth can
surpass, or even be compared with, Amalfi in the
perfect lustre of its setting? What loftier or bolder
cliffs than those of Capri can the wild bleak headlands
of the North Sea exhibit? The fertile lands of
France cannot vie with the richness of the Sorrentine
Plain, nor can any mountain on the face of the globe
rival in human interest the peak of Vesuvius;
Pompeii is unique, the most precious storehouse of
ancient knowledge the world possesses; whilst the
Bay of Baia recalls the days of Roman power and
luxury more vividly to our minds than any place
save the Eternal City itself. And again: what illustrious
names in history and in literature—classical,
medieval, modern—are for ever associated with these
smiling shores! Robert Guiscard and Hildebrand
in quiet Salerno, Tasso at health-giving Sorrento,
Vittoria Colonna in her palace-fortress on the crags
of Ischia, the great Apostle of the west at Puteoli:—these
are but a few of the more eminent and gracious
figures that arise before us at the casual bidding of
memory. Then there are the infamous, as well as
the virtuous and the gallant, whose misdeeds are
still freshly remembered upon these coasts or in
their fertile valleys. The sinister Tiberius, the half-crazy
and wholly vicious Caligula, many a king and
queen of evil repute that ruled Naples, the vile Pier-Luigi
Farnese, the adventurer Joachim Murat, all
have left the marks of their personality upon the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6">[pg 6]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>coveted shores of the Neapolitan Riviera. From
the days of the Sibyl and of the Trojan hero to
the stirring times of Garibaldi and of King Bomba,
which were but of yesterday, Naples and its environs
have played a prominent part in the annals and
development of the civilised western world; Roman
emperors, Pagan statesmen and poets, Norman, French
and Spanish princes, popes, saints and theologians,
merchants and scientists of the Middle Ages, writers
of the Renaissance and heroes of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Risorgimento</span></span>,
all have combined to shed a halo of historical romance
upon Naples and its Riviera, where there is scarcely
a sea-girt town or a crumbling fortress that is not
redolent of the memory of some personage whose
name is inscribed on the roll of European history.
It seems but right, therefore, that many works should
have been written concerning this favoured corner of
Italy, so replete with natural charm and with historical
interest; and in truth multitudes of books, large and
small, witty and dull, erudite and empty, light and
heavy, prosaic and rhapsodical, have poured forth
from the prolific pens of generations of authors. We
feel sincerely the need of an apology for making a
fresh addition to the ever-increasing pile of Neapolitan
literature, and we can only urge in extenuation of
our crime of authorship that the same scene appeals
in varied ways to different persons, and that every
fresh description is apt to shed additional light upon
old familiar subjects. In the following pages we
make no profession to act the part of a guide to
the neighbourhood of Naples, for are there not the
carefully prepared pages of Murray and Baedeker, to
say nothing of the works of such writers as Augustus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7">[pg 7]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Hare, to lead the wanderer into every church and
castle, to show him every nook in valley and mountain,
and to supply him thoroughly with accurate dates
and facts? No, our treatment of this theme may
be deemed a poor one, but it has at least the merit
and the courage of following its own peculiar lines.
For we pursue our own course, and we touch lightly
here and omit there; we run to dissertation in this
place, we glide by silently in another. We take our
own views of people and places, and give them for
what they are worth to our readers to approve or to
condemn, as they think fit. We offer a medley of
history and of imagination, of biography and of private
comment; and we crave indulgence for our short-comings
by observing that any deficiencies in these
pages can easily be remedied by application to the
abundant literature upon Naples and its surrounding
districts which every good library is presumed to
contain.

That little stream the Sebeto, which is indeed, as
the courtly Metastasio observes, <span class="tei tei-q">“scanty in depth
of water though overflowing with honour,”</span> may be considered
as the boundary line that divides the city of
Naples from its eastern environs, although it is evident
that the whole stretch of coast from Posilipo to
Torre del Greco is covered with an unbroken line of
houses. Past the highly cultivated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paduli</span></span>, the chief
market-gardens on this side of the city, with the town
of La Barra on the fertile slopes to our left, we pass
by way of San Giovanni a Teduccio to Portici, once
a favourite resort of royalty. Here the dilettante
Charles III., first Bourbon King of Naples, built a
palace and laid out gardens in the days of patches
and powder, constructing a royal pleasaunce that was
destined to become the chief residence of the temporary
supplanter of his own family, Joachim Murat, the
citizen king of Naples and brother-in-law of the great
Napoleon. Villa and gardens still remain, but
monarchs have ceased to visit Portici since the days
of Bomba, and the old royal demesne has been turned
into an agricultural college. Adjoining and practically
forming part of Portici is the town of Resina, which
preserves almost intact the old classical name of Retina
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page9">[pg 9]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that it bore in the distant days when it served as the
port of Herculaneum. Here then in the mean streets
of Resina we find ourselves standing above, though
certainly not upon, historic ground, for the temples and
villas, the theatres and private houses of the famous
buried city lie far below the surface trodden by our
feet. To visit Herculaneum it is necessary for us to
descend some seventy to a hundred feet into the
depths of the earth, passing more than one layer of
ancient lava, for Resina and Portici themselves are but
modern editions of former towns that have been
engulfed in the course of ages. If the stranger can
derive any solid satisfaction from the descent by a
gloomy underground passage and from fleeting glimpses
of ancient walls and dwellings seen through a forest of
wooden baulks, which serve to support the spaces
excavated, he must indeed be an enthusiast. But
most people, perhaps all sensible people, will be content
to take the undoubted interest of Herculaneum
on trust, probably agreeing (at any rate after their
visit) that the inspection of this subterranean city is
not worth the candle, by whose flickering beams alone
can objects be distinguished in the oppressive darkness.
Personally we strongly hold to the expressed opinion
of Alexandre Dumas, who declared that even the most
hardened antiquary could not desire more than one
hour’s contemplation of this hidden mass of shapeless
wreckage. <span class="tei tei-q">“Herculaneum,”</span> writes that genial Frenchman,
<span class="tei tei-q">“but wearies our curiosity instead of exciting it.
We descend into the excavated city as into a mine by
a species of shaft; then come corridors beneath the
earth which can only be entered by the light of tapers;
and these smoke-grimed passages allow us from time
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page10">[pg 10]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to time to obtain a momentary glimpse of the angle of
a house, the colonnade of some temple, the steps of a
theatre. Everything is fragmentary, mutilated, dingy,
uncertain, confused, and therefore unsatisfactory. Well,
at the end of an hour spent in wandering amongst
these abysmal recesses, the most hardened archæologist,
the most dry-as-dust antiquary, the most inquisitive
of tourists begins to experience only one feeling—an
intense desire to ascend to the light of day and to
breathe once more the fresh air of the upper world.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nevertheless, it was from these dismal caverns, black
as Erebus, that some of the choicest marbles and
bronzes that now adorn the Museum at Naples were
originally extracted. From a villa at Herculaneum
also was taken the famous collection of 3000 rolls of
papyrus, chiefly filled with the writings of the Epicurean
philosopher Philodemus, perhaps the greatest <span class="tei tei-q">“find”</span>
of ancient literature that has yet been made, although
the contents of this damaged library, deciphered with
equal toil and ingenuity, have not proved to be of the
value originally set upon them by expectant scholars.
But much of the city itself has yet hardly been touched
since the days when it was destroyed in the reign of
Titus, so that far below the squalid lanes of Portici
and Resina there must still exist acres upon acres of
undisturbed buildings, public and private, many of
them perhaps filled with priceless works of Greek and
Roman art, for Herculaneum, unlike Pompeii, was
never tampered with by the ancients themselves, for
the coating of volcanic mud, which filled the whole
area of the city, made impracticable a systematic
searching of its ruins by the despoiled citizens. Then,
as if nature had not already buried the city sufficiently
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page11">[pg 11]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>deep, subsequent eruptions of Vesuvius have superimposed
additional layers of lava, whilst confiding
human beings have in their turn built habitations upon
the volcanic crust.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We all know the story, perhaps mythical, of the
discovery of Herculaneum at the beginning of the
eighteenth century by the accidental sinking of a well
upon its long-forgotten site and of the subsequent
excavations made by the Prince d’Elbœuf. These so-called
explorations were, however, made in the most
greedy and destructive spirit, for the prince’s sole
object was to obtain antique works of art for his
private collection, not to make intelligent enquiries
about the dead and buried city lying beneath his
estate. Ignorant workmen were despatched to hew
and hack wholesale in the mirky depths in order to
discover statuary and paintings, and since there was
no receptacle at hand to contain the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">débris</span></span>, they took
the simple course of filling in each hollow made with
the masses of rubbish already excavated. Later in the
same century the Bourbon king was induced by
Neapolitan savants to take some interest in the work,
but, strange to relate, the superintendent appointed, a
certain Spanish officer named Alcubier, was so ignorant
and careless that half the objects found under his
supervision were broken or lost before they reached
Naples; this ignoramus, it was said, even went so far
as to order whole architraves to be smashed up and
their bronze lettering to be picked out before making
a copy of the original inscription! Under these
circumstances the marvel is that anything of beauty
or value should have survived at all, for this selfish
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg 12]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>plundering of Herculaneum, in strong contrast with
the reverent treatment meted out to Pompeii, may be
considered one of the greatest pieces of vandalism
ever perpetrated. In spite of this wholesale destruction,
however, there must remain untouched, as we
have said, a vast quantity of objects, beautiful, useful
or curious, yet it is extremely doubtful if we shall live
to see any serious and intelligent effort made to bring
these hidden treasures forth to the light of day.
The expense of working this buried hoard would
be enormous in any case, whilst the existence of the
houses of Resina and Portici overhead necessitates
special measures of precaution on the part of the
excavators. The only method of examining Herculaneum
properly would be in fact to treat the buried
site like an immense mine by the construction of
regular galleries and shafts for the entrance of skilled
workmen, and to remove the rubbish displaced to the
outer air. Perhaps some multi-millionaire might be
found ready to undertake so arduous, yet so fascinating
a task, though we fear that the Italian Government,
which has always shown itself as tenacious of its
subterranean wealth of antiquity as it appears languid
in the work of quarrying it, would indignantly refuse
to accede to any such offer. As regards the ancient
city of Hercules, therefore, we must perforce remain
content to inspect the magnificent bronzes and the
other objects of interest that are to be found in the
Museum of Naples, for we are not likely to see any
further researches just at present, more’s the pity,
since there is every reason to suppose that a thorough
investigation conducted regardless of cost would yield up
to the world the most marvellous and valuable results.

Some two miles of dusty suburb lie between Resina
and Torre del Greco, which has been destroyed time
after time by the lava streams descending from <span class="tei tei-q">“that
peak of Hell rising out of Paradise,”</span> as Goethe once
named the burning mountain overhead. Nevertheless,
the Torrese continue to sit patiently at the feet of
the fire-spouting monster, trembling when he is angry,
pleased when he is quiescent, and ready to abandon
meekly their homes when he renders them insupportable
by his furious outbursts. Yet these people never
fail to return and risk the ever-present chances of
death and destruction. And little can we blame
them for their fatalism, when we gaze upon the
glorious views that reveal themselves at this spot,
whence Naples rising proudly from the sea, the rocky
islands of Ischia and Capri, the aerial heights of
Monte Sant’ Angelo and all the features of the placid
bay are seen spread around us in a panorama of
unsurpassed loveliness. Beneath lava rocks, black
and sinister, that contrast strangely in their sombre
hues with the brilliant tints of sea and sky, lie little
beaches of glittering gravel that would afford delightful
retreats for meditation, were it not for the dozens
of half-naked brown-skinned imps, children of the
fisher-folk of Torre del Greco, who wallow in the warm
sand or rush with joyful screams into the tepid surf.
The population must have increased not a little since
those days, nearly a century ago, when the unhappy
Shelley could find peace and solitude in his darkest
hours of unrest upon these shores, where it would be
well-nigh impossible for a twentieth-century poet to
espy a retreat for soothing his soul in verse. Yet
somehow, during the drowsy noontide rest when the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg 14]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>active life of the South ceases, if only for an hour or
so, it is still possible to catch the spirit in which that
melancholy wanderer indited one of his most exquisite
lyrics:—sunshine, clear sky, murmuring seas, the
fragrance of the Italian spring, all are present to our
reverie; and how true and perfect a picture has the
poet-artist drawn for us of this beautiful Vesuvian
shore!

But it must be admitted that the seashore by
Torre del Greco does not often lend itself as a
suitable spot for romantic or solitary communings
with nature; it is a busy place where the struggle

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the eastern side of Naples is sometimes designated,
the old command given to the first parents of mankind—<span class="tei tei-q">“by
the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat
bread”</span>—is scrupulously observed in Torre del Greco.
It is little enough, however, that these frugal people
demand, for a hunk of coarse bread, tempered with a
handful of beans or an orange in winter or with a
slice of luscious pink water-melon or a few figs in
summer, is thought to constitute a full meal in this
climate; nor are these simple viands washed down by
anything more potent than a draught of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mezzo-vino</span></span>,
the weak sour wine of the country. A dish of
maccaroni or a plateful of kid or veal garnished with
vegetables is a treat to be reserved for a marriage or
some great Church festival, whilst a chicken is regarded
as a luxury in which only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gran’ signori</span></span> of
boundless wealth can afford to indulge. Amongst the
many classes of toilers with which populous Torre del
Greco abounds, that of the coral-fishers is perhaps the
most interesting. There is pure romance in the very
notion of hunting for the beautiful coloured substance
lying hidden in the crystalline depths of the Mediterranean,
and its quest is not a little suggestive of
azure caverns beneath the waves, peopled by soft-eyed
mermaids and strange iridescent fishes. As a matter
of fact, it would be difficult to name a harder occupation
or a more dismal monotonous existence than that
of the coral-fishers, many hundreds of whom leave
this little port every spring in order to spend the
summer months on the coasts of Tripoli, Sardinia, or
Sicily. The men employed, who work under contract
during some six months of unending drudgery, are by
no means all natives of Torre del Greco, but are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg 16]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>collected from various places of the neighbourhood,
not a few of them being thrifty youths from Capri,
who are eager to amass as quickly as possible the
lump sum of money requisite to permit of marriage.
It is true that the amount actually paid by the
owners of the coral fleet sounds proportionately large,
yet it is in reality poor enough recompense when
measured by the ceaseless toil, the burning heat and
the wretched food, which the venture entails. The
lot of the coral-fisher has however much improved of
late years, partly by measures of government which
now compel the contractors to treat their servants
more humanely, and partly by the fact that the
practice of emigration in Southern Italy has reduced
the numbers of applicants for the coral-fishing business
and has thereby, indirectly at least, raised wages and
bettered the old conditions of service. A truly pitiable
account is given of these poor creatures some thirty
years ago by an English writer, whose knowledge of
the Neapolitan people and character remains probably
unsurpassed; and it is some satisfaction to reflect that
even in Mr Stamer’s day the bad old oppressive system
had already been somewhat tempered for the benefit
of these white slaves, who for nearly half the round of
the year were worse treated than King Bomba’s unhappy
victims in the pestilent prisons of Naples and
Gaeta.

<span class="tei tei-q">“Badly paid, badly fed, and hard worked is the poor
coral-fisher. Compared with his, the life of a galley-slave
is one of sybaritical indolence. His treatment
was, until very recently, not one whit better than that

imagination of Mrs Harriet Beecher Stowe;

alongside of whom Mr Legree would have seemed a

His word was law and a rope’s end well laid on his
sole reply to any remonstrance on the part of his
bondsmen. For six days out of the seven he kept
them working incessantly, not unfrequently on the
seventh into the bargain, if the weather was favourable;
and that they might be strong, hearty and able to

In those <span class="tei tei-q">“good old days,”</span> not so very far distant,
the dredging nets were coarse and weighty, and the
capstan of the clumsiest and most primitive description,
so that the coral-seeking serfs under contract were
worked like bullocks until they were often wont to
fall asleep out of sheer exhaustion as they hauled
away mechanically. We can imagine then with what
raptures of joy these ill-treated mortals must have
hailed the advent of October, the month that terminated
their long spell of suffering and semi-starvation,
and with what eagerness they must have returned
homewards, the more industrious to perform odd jobs
during the winter season on farms or in factories; the
lazier to enjoy a well-earned holiday of loafing on the
quay or in the piazza. And although times have
changed for the better in the eyes of the coral-fisher,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page18">[pg 18]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his lot still remains hard enough, even in the present
days of grace; whilst any employment that saps the
workman’s strength during the hot summer months
and leaves him idle or unemployed in winter time
cannot well be described as a desirable trade. Yet
the temptation to obtain a considerable sum of money
in advance, as is the case in this particular industry,
often proves overwhelming to the young man of the
Torres or of Castellamare, imprudently married before
he is out of his teens and with an ever-increasing
family. It is so easy to accept the proffered gold,
which will keep wife and babies in comparative comfort
throughout the long hot summer; unskilled labour
is paid so lightly on these teeming shores of the Terra
di Lavoro; saddled already with children he cannot
make up his feeble mind to emigrate; in short, to go
a-coralling is his sole chance, if he wishes to keep his
home together and to stave off charity or starvation
from his young wife and family.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beyond Torre del Greco we seem to escape to
a certain extent from the enveloping network of
human dwellings, so that we are at last enabled
to gain some idea of the natural features of the
country. The oriental character of the landscape,
which marks more or less distinctly the whole of
the Neapolitan coast-line, will at once be noticed in
the domed farm buildings, not unlike Mahommedan
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">koubbas</span></span>, washed a glistening white, that stand out
sharply against the lugubrious tints of the lava beds.
Above us, crowning a bosky hillock that juts forth
from the mountain flank, stands one of the many
convents of the monks of Camaldoli, whose houses are
scattered throughout the breadth of Southern Italy.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page19">[pg 19]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>The position of their Vesuvian settlement is certainly
unique, for the rising ground on which it is perched
appears like some verdant oasis amid the arid fields
of sable lava. Secure in its commanding site, the
monastery has many a time been completely surrounded
by burning streams, which have invariably
left the building and its woody demesne unscathed.
More than once have the good brethren, who wear the
white robe of St Romualdo of Ravenna, looked down
from their convent walls upon the work of destruction
below, and have watched the waves of liquid fire surging
angrily but uselessly round the rocky base of their
retreat. Hard manual labour, prayer, solitude and
contemplation: these are the chief duties enjoined by
the famous Tuscan order, and surely no more suitable
place for carrying out such precepts could have been
chosen by the pious founder of this Vesuvian convent.
For what scenes on earth could be deemed more
beautiful to contemplate, we wonder, than the wide
stretches of heaven and ocean, of fertile plain and of
rugged mountain, that are ever before the eyes of
the brethren; or more instructive than the constant
spectacle of disappointed human ambition and energy,
which is afforded by the barren lava beds and the
ruined cities close at hand!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Descending from the slopes of Camaldoli, we cross
a tract of country wherein black lava alternates with
patches of rich cultivation and of thriving vineyards,
and gaining the high road we soon reach Torre
Annunziata. Here it is evident that the manufacture
of maccaroni forms the chief industry of its population,
for on all sides are to be seen the frames filled with
the golden coloured strings of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pasta</span></span> that have been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg 20]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hung up to dry in the sunshine. Every flat roof
in the place, moreover, is covered with smooth concrete
and protected by a low parapet for the spreading of
the grain, and on the beach are laid huge cloths
of coarse brown material that are heaped with masses
of the crude corn, whilst men with their naked feet
from time to time turn the grain so as to dry the
whole bulk. Torre Annunziata and its inland neighbour,
Gragnano, are in fact the two chief local scenes
of this industry with which the Bay of Naples has
always been so closely associated, and it is here that
we can best make ourselves acquainted with the
process of manufacturing maccaroni. By following
any one of the tall brown-skinned fellows, stripped to
the waist and bare-legged, who have been breathing
the fresh air of the street for a few moments, we
quickly arrive at the entrance of one of the many
small factories with which the town abounds. In spite
of open doors and windows its atmosphere feels hot
and stifling, for it is impregnated with tiny particles
of flour dust, which too often, alas! are apt to affect
permanently the lungs of the workmen. The dough
of maccaroni is obtained by mixing pure wheaten
flour with semolina in certain proportions, only water
being used for the purpose, whilst the task of kneading
is carried out in primitive fashion by means of a lever
worked continuously by two or more men. When the
dough has at length arrived at the required consistency
after some hours of steady kneading, it is placed in a
large perforated copper cylinder, each hole having
a central pin at the bottom and a valve on top. A
powerful screw is then employed to press down upon
the dough, which is thus squeezed out of the
imprison<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ing cylinder through the holes in the serpentine shape
that is so familiar to us. On reaching a certain length
these pipes, issuing from the holes, are twisted off and
are then removed for drying to the frames in the open
air. Maccaroni has, of course, many varieties of form
and quality, from the thin fluffy vermicelli, known
under the poetical name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Capilli degli Angeli</span></span>, to
the great thick pipe-stem-like article of ordinary
commerce. There are endless means of cooking and
dressing this, the national dish of Italy, but perhaps
the most popular of all is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">alla Napolitana</span></span>, wherein
it is served with tomato sauce, to which a sprinkling
of grated Parmesan cheese is frequently added. A
compound of eggs and maccaroni, sometimes known
as a Neapolitan omelette, likewise makes an appetising
dish, though it is one that is little known to foreigners.
One circumstance is patent; the dismal so-called
<span class="tei tei-q">“maccaroni pudding”</span> one meets with in England
seems to have nothing in common with the delicately
flavoured, sustaining dish that can be obtained for
a few pence in any Southern restaurant.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Torre Annunziata has the reputation of being a
dirty malodorous town, composed of shabby stone
houses and full of quarrelsome people. Well, perhaps
there is a scintilla of truth in the sweeping observation,
yet if we can contrive to endure the smells and racket
of the place for a brief space of time, there is much
of human interest to be observed in the daily scenes
of its crowded beach and its noisy streets. After all,
no odours of the South can compare in all-pervading
intensity with the blended aroma of fried fish and
London fog that old Drury Lane can often produce;
nor are the Torrese more dangerous to strangers or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>more objectionable in their habits than the crowds of
Lambeth or Seven Dials. In strength of lungs, it
must be granted, the Italian easily surpasses the
Londoner, for the Southern voice is positively alarming
in its vigour and its far-reaching power. No one—man,
woman or child—can apparently speak below
a scream; even the most amiable or trivial of conversations
seems to our unaccustomed ears to portend
an imminent quarrel, to so high a pitch are the
naturally harsh voices strained. Morning, noon and
night the same hubbub of men shouting, of women
screeching, and of children yelling continues for
nobody minds noise in Italy, where people are
troubled with no nerves of their own and consequently
have no consideration for those of strangers. And
why, therefore, should they suspend their native habits
to please a handful of cavilling <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">forestieri</span></span>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A stroll through Torre Annunziata, although it
possesses not a few drawbacks, can be made both
amusing and instructive; we can even find something
attractive in the quality of the local atmosphere, which
suggests at one and the same time sunshine, garlic,
incense, stale fish and wood smoke; it is the pungent
but characteristic aroma of the South, filled <span class="tei tei-q">“with
spicy odours Time can never mar.”</span> And what truly
charming pictures do the family groups present in
the wide archways giving on the untidy courts within,
full of sun and shadow and gay with bright-coloured
garments swaying in the wind! The ebon-haired
young mother with teeth like pearls and with warm-tinted
cheeks sits fondling the last helpless little
addition to her growing family, whilst toddlers of any
age from two to seven, unkempt but bright-eyed and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page23">[pg 23]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>engaging, play around the door-step, watched over by
their grandmother, or may be their great-grandam,
who with her wizened face enfolded in her yellow
kerchief, her skinny neck, and her distaff in the bony
fingers, looks as if she had stepped out of some
Renaissance painting of the Three Fates in a Florentine
gallery. Crimson carnations in earthenware pots stand
on the steps of the outside staircase, giving a touch of
refinement to the squalid home, and from the balcony
overhead the glossy-black, yellow-billed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">passer solitario</span></span>,
the favourite cage-bird of the Neapolitan poor, chirrups
with apparent cheerfulness in his wicker-work prison.
Behind, in the dim shadows of the large room, which
serves as sole habitation, we can espy the inevitable
household altar with the oil lamp glimmering before
the little crude-coloured print of the Virgin and Child,
and its usual accessory, the piece of palm or olive
that was blessed by the priest last Palm Sunday;
poor and mean though the chamber be, its bed linen
and simple appointments are more cleanly than might
perhaps be inferred from the appearance of the family
itself. In a shady corner close by, three or four young
labourers at their mid-day rest have finished their
frugal repast of bread and beans, and are now playing
eagerly the popular game of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">zecchinetto</span></span> with a frayed
and grimy pack of cards. Wives or sweethearts
watch with anxious faces from a respectful distance,
for it is not meet to disturb the lords of creation when
they happen to be engaged in a game of chance.
What possibilities of farce and tragedy can be drawn
from so simple, so common a scene upon these shores,
where human life is less artificially conducted than
elsewhere in Europe, and where human passions are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg 24]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>kept under less restraint? Terrible are the tales of
jealousy and revenge, of deliberate treachery and of
uncontrolled violence, which are related of these quick-tempered
grown-up children of the South, who seem
to love and hate with the blind intensity of untutored
savages.

Here lies the sleeping fisherman, worn out probably
with hours of hauling at the heavy nets, who is snatching
a chance hour of repose, prone upon his chest with
face buried in his crossed arms. Little he seems to
reck of the damp of the soil or the heat of the sun,
nor can a noisy game of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mora</span></span> played by a couple of
his companions beside him disturb his deep slumber.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mora</span></span> has ever been the classic game of the South,
and indeed, there is abundant evidence to show that
it was played by the ancestors of these dwellers in
Magna Graecia hundreds of years before Pompeii was
overthrown. The game, which requires nothing but
the human fingers, bears no little resemblance to our
own humble pastime of <span class="tei tei-q">“Up Jenkin!”</span> which may
almost be described as a species of drawing-room <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mora</span></span>;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg 25]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>perhaps some Italian traveller in a past age may
actually have introduced this form of the southern
diversion into prosaic England. The two players, face
to face and craning forward with outstretched necks,
simultaneously extend their right hands with one or
more fingers pointing upward, the aim of each man
being to guess the exact number, from two to ten,
jointly displayed by both right hands. If one of them
hit upon the correct figure, then he gains one point
towards the stakes, which are usually made in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">centesimi</span></span>
rather than in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">soldi</span></span>. How rapidly do the lean supple
brown fingers flash backwards and forwards, and with
what gusto do the two frenzied combatants yell out
their numbers! <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mora</span></span> has been a favourite recreation
with these people almost from their cradles, and he
would be a bold man indeed who would venture to
challenge a Torrese at this game, for the native’s skill
and experience are almost bound to tell eventually in
his favour, and the odds are <span class="tei tei-q">“Lombard Street to a
China orange”</span> against the outside player. There are
certain maxims too with regard to the game which
are closely observed by those who play it, as well as
peculiar expressions, such as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tutte</span></span> to denote that all
ten fingers are being shown, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">chiarella</span></span> for all but
one. Five points usually make the game, and these
are commonly marked by holding up one or more
fingers of the disengaged left hand.—These are a few
of the many sights to be witnessed by those who can
afford to endure the pestering attentions of small boys,
and the uncomplimentary staring of the adult population
in such places as the Torres or Castellamare; and
such as wish to make themselves acquainted with the
details of southern life and manners cannot do better
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page26">[pg 26]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>than pass an idle hour in the fishmarket or the piazza
of these little industrial towns of the Vesuvian shore.
For to regard Southern Italy from the majestic isolation
of a railway compartment or a hired carriage cannot
possibly give the traveller the smallest insight into the
ordinary phases of local life; for he is ever looking,
as it were, into a picture from which all trace of colour
has vanished.

It is but a short quarter of an hour by train from
Torre Annunziata to Castellamare di Stabia, the ill-fated
Stabiae of the Romans, which shared the evil lot
of Pompeii and Herculaneum. On our right we have
the sea, with the castle-topped islet of Revigliano,
whilst on looking to the left we can survey the fertile
valley of the Sarno, and the shapeless mounds which
hide that precious goal of every traveller to these
shores, the buried city of Pompeii. Everywhere thrives
sub-tropical vegetation:—cactus and aloe draped in
wreaths of smilax; tall straggling masses of scarlet
geranium that cling for protection to the Indian fig,
and blossom in security amid their spiky but safe
retreats; shrubs of fragrant yellow genista; clumps of
purple-leaved <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ricini</span></span>, as the Italians name the castor-oil
plant. If it were summer time, the daturas would be
covered with their great white floral trumpets, and
every oleander bush would be one blaze of the coarse
carmine blossoms that are here called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mazza di San
Giuseppe</span></span>, or St Joseph’s nosegay, and a very gaudy
rank bouquet they make. But in spring-time the
oleander can but display long greyish leaves and pods
of snowy fluff, which is blown hither and thither like
thistle-down on the air; and it is only in flaming
summer that these regions are brightened by St
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Joseph’s flower, or by the still more gorgeous masses of
the mesembryanthemum, which clambers on all sides
over the lava rock and hangs in crimson festoons
from tufa cliffs, making impossibly splendid splashes of
colour in the landscape.

So many writers have expatiated upon the sordid
ugliness of Castellamare and upon the beauty of the
wooded slopes above the town, that a further description
of the place may well be dispensed with.
Uninteresting, however, as this industrial town
appears, it boasts a long historical record, to which
its crumbling medieval castle bears witness. The
great Emperor Frederick the Second, the scholar-pope
Pius the Second, and all the monarchs of the Angevin,
Aragonese and Bourbon dynasties have been associated
with this <span class="tei tei-q">“castle by the sea.”</span> The whole
district was once the property of that human monster
Pier-Luigi Farnese, duke of Parma, heir of Pope
Paul the Third, of whose demoniacal cruelty and
treachery the racy pages of Cellini’s Memoirs give
so vivid an account, and whose repulsive face has
grown familiar to us from Titian’s famous portraits
in the gallery of Naples. It was the evil Pier-Luigi’s
descendant and heiress-general of the family, Elizabeth
Farnese, Queen of Spain, who conveyed the beautiful
villa and woods of Quisisana to the Bourbon kings,
and here the Neapolitan royal family for several
generations sought health (as the name of the place
implies) and repose upon the breezy heights that lie
so conveniently near to the great city in full view to
the west. Nowadays the old royal villa, deserted
by crowned heads since Ferdinand’s days and fallen
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg 28]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>from its high estate to its present use of a hotel and
pension, forms with its park the chief attraction of
Castellamare, where English travellers are wont to
congregate in winter, and Neapolitan and Greek
seekers of pleasure or drinkers of medicinal waters
resort in the hot summer months. The Southerners
who come here for their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">villeggiatura</span></span> certainly enjoy
a better time than the winter visitors, for the bulky
form of Monte Sant’ Angelo intercepts much of the
sunshine, thereby rendering the place damp and
chilly in the cold season of the year. Nominally it
is the mineral springs that attract the Neapolitan
folk, wherein they have a fine choice of health-giving
beverages, varying from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">acqua ferrata</span></span>, a mild
chalybeate that is found useful as a tonic, to the
powerful <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">acqua del Muraglione</span></span>, that is warranted to
reduce the stoutest mortal to a mere shadow of his
former self in a trice. But though the waters may
be occasionally sipped of a morning and wry faces
made, it is in reality the warm sea-bathing on the
shore, where people spend hours pickling in tepid
salt water, and also the cool rides or walks amongst
the shady alleys of sweet chestnut and ilex woods of
Quisisana and Monte Coppola, which draw hither in
summer the elegant world of Naples, and even of
Athens, to visit Castellamare. The leafy groves on
the zephyr-swept hill sides, once sacred to the pleasures
of Bourbon tyrants, now ring with peals of noisy
laughter, with gallant compliments, and with the
harsh shouting of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ciucciari</span></span>, the leaders of the
poor over-driven donkeys. Unhappy patient beasts!
usually covered with raws and galls, that are urged
forward at a gallop by the remorseless stick, or even
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page29">[pg 29]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by the goad, for the Neapolitan donkey-boy is
absolutely callous to the feelings of his animal. Not
that he is cruel out of sheer cussedness, for cruelty’s
sake, for he can be really kind to his dog or his cat;
but the beast of burden, the helpless uncomplaining
servant of man, suffers terribly at his hands. It is
useless to remonstrate or argue with the young
ruffian, who at our sharp reprimand will merely open
wide his big black eyes and stare in genuine amazement.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Non sono Cristiani</span></span>—they have no souls, and
the beasts are their property and not yours; what
does it matter then to you how they are treated,
provided they carry you properly? That is the sum
total of the donkey-boy’s argument, and he has high
ecclesiastical authority to back up his private theory,
if he had the wit to enter into a discussion with us
on the subject. Almost equally hopeless is it to
point to the simple fact that a well-groomed, well-treated
animal lasts longer than a half-starved, mutilated
scare-crow. <span class="tei tei-q">“How old is your horse?”</span> we once
asked a driver in the south. <span class="tei tei-q">“He is very old indeed,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eccelenza</span></span>,”</span> was the reply; <span class="tei tei-q">“he must be nearly twelve!”</span>
On being informed that horses often worked well up
to twenty years old and over in England, he let us
infer, quite politely, that he thought we were romancing.
Tenderness towards the dumb creation is a
common, not to say a prevailing characteristic of
the Anglo-Saxon race, and it must be confessed
that the thoughtless and horrible cruelty towards
animals witnessed on all sides in the Neapolitan
Riviera amounts to a serious drawback to the full
enjoyment of its many beauties and amenities.
Matters are improving a little of late, it is only fair
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page30">[pg 30]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to add. There is an Italian Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, and its officials have done
some good in the streets of Naples itself, but naturally
its new ideas have not yet penetrated far into the
country districts.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the healthy and energetic the most delightful
excursion that Castellamare can offer is the ascent to
the summit of Monte Sant’ Angelo, that monarch of
the Bay of Naples, whose lofty crest gleams with
snowy streaks until the spring be well advanced. The
lazy or the feeble can make use of one of the poor
oppressed donkeys, but it is better to engage its
ragged master, who without his four-footed drudge
to whack and kick is a harmless enough being,
to act as guide over the steep ill-defined pathway that
leads ever upwards. As we slowly ascend through the
sub-tropical region of fig and vine, of olive and
carouba, we question our guide, who in spite of his
bright eyes and well-knit frame seems about as
intelligent a companion as the poor ass left behind in
the stall, where he is enjoying, let us hope, an unexpected
holiday. It is not easy to extract information
from our native attendant, yet with a little judicious
pressing we learn from him that the top of the mountain,
which is our bourne, was once inhabited by evil
spirits, until a holy hermit took up his abode on the
peak, since when his sanctity has kept the place
tolerably clear of witches and foul incubi. Wicked
sprites, however, still haunt the spreading woods of
beech and chestnut which we must presently traverse,
and our guide (whose name is Vincenzo) admits to
us that he would not care to venture there alone, even
in broad daylight. There is, he tells us, warming up at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg 31]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>last to the subject, much gold hidden there, which the
spirits guard so jealously that they are ready to tear
in pieces any mortal who is clever enough to find and
bold enough to rifle their secret hoards. Only a
priest, on account of his sacred office, is reckoned safe
from their iniquitous spells. <span class="tei tei-q">“But has not any one
dared,”</span> we ask, <span class="tei tei-q">“to go in company with a holy man,
to search for this hidden treasure?”</span> Well, yes, he
had been told that men from Vico had once ventured
up into the woods to search for the gold. With a
little encouragement Vincenzo is finally prevailed upon
to give us the whole story, which is evidently of somewhat
recent date.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Once upon a time there were four men, one of them
being a priest, who lived in Vico, and one of these
men had often been told by his father that in the
forests near the top of Monte Sant’ Angelo there lay
buried a chest full of gold—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">molto! molto!</span></span> The father
of the man had been himself in his youth to search
for the treasure, but find it he never could, for he
would never take a priest with him to avert the spells
of the evil spirits of the mountain sides, who kept the
place hidden. So this time the man chose two out of his
friends, the boldest and the trustiest he could fix upon,
to accompany him, and at the same time he obtained
the promise of a cousin, who was a priest, to assist in
the undertaking. All four made their way up to the
woods, and whilst the three men were digging and
searching, the priest continued to read aloud the incantations
out of a certain book he had brought with
him for the purpose. In course of time the chest was
discovered to the joy of all, and sure enough it was
bulging with the desired gold pieces. They opened
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg 32]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it without difficulty, and the four friends divided its
contents in equal shares. Scarcely had the work of
division been carried out, than there came a loud voice
issuing from the unknown, calling out the question:—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Che
ferete con questo tesoro?</span></span>”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mangeremo, beveremo!</span></span>”</span>
boldly replied one of the group, to whom this
sudden accession of wealth offered dreams of unlimited
platters of maccaroni and countless flasks of ruby-red
Gragnano in the future. <span class="tei tei-q">“We shall eat, we shall drink,
but we shall also make abundant alms!”</span> called out
another—let us hope it was the priest!—but no sooner
had the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">elemosina</span></span> (alms) been uttered than there
was heard a most terrific rattling of chains, the gold
pieces turned to dead leaves in the affrighted mortals’
hands, and the four men took to their heels and fled
in alarm down the mountain flank.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Vincenzo believes this tale implicitly, just as it was
related to him, and he adds to combat our own incredulity
that the priest and one of the men who took
part in this strange adventure were still living and
ready to confirm the story, but that of the remaining
two, one was now dead, and the other had been deaf
and dumb ever since the event. It seem a pity to criticise
Vincenzo’s simple little narrative, which makes a
pretty fairy-story and points a sound moral, as it stands.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We enter the fresh scented woods that have now
replaced in our climb the rich cultivated crops and
terraced gardens, and here amidst the clumps of
ancient chestnuts our guide points out to us the great
snow-pits, the contents of which are used to cool the
water sold by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">acquaioli</span></span> during hot summer nights
in the sultry streets of Naples. These pits are dug
about fifty feet deep, and half as much across, being
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page33">[pg 33]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>conical in shape with a grating placed a short distance
above the tapering base to allow the melted snow to
drain off into the soil. The sides of each pit are first
well-lined with straw and leafy branches, and the new-fallen
snow shovelled in and forced into a solid mass
by pressure from above, whilst on top is placed a
sound thatched roof. As we wander through the
silent woods we see patches of anemones, white and
blue, lying upon the leaf-strewn ground, and beside
them in many places are tufts of the pale starry primroses;
coarse spurge, and lush masses of the hellebore
with its large pale green flowers and dark leaves
are common enough on all sides. From amongst the
naked trees we emerge into the bare bleak stony
stretches that lead to the summit, covered with the
coarse but aromatic vegetation that clothes the dry
limestone wastes of the south. How truly marvellous
is the description of these wind-swept, weed-grown
solitudes that Robert Browning presents to us in
what is perhaps the most truly Italian in feeling of
all his poems, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Englishman in Italy!”</span> For here
with the rich imagination, worthy of some of Shelley’s
finest flights, is mingled an accurate appreciation of
Nature, of which Wordsworth might well be proud;
for the Lake poet himself could not have improved
upon this exquisite description of the various shrubs
and plants of a limestone hill-top in Italy.

Above our heads hovers a kite, performing graceful
circles in the keen clear air and breaking the oppressive
silence of the place with his shrill screams, for his
mate must have her nest hidden in some cleft of yon
grey towering cliff. A pair of crested hoopoes with
brown plumage and ruddy breasts keep fluttering a
little way before us, uttering from time to time their
curious notes of alarm. Mercifully these handsome
birds have escaped the fowler, who lays his snares
even amongst the spirit-haunted crags of this desolate
region. The hoopoe, though a very rare visitor to
our northern shores, is fairly common on the Mediterranean
coast, and he would be still more frequently
encountered, were it not for his hereditary enemy,
Man. There is a venerable legend concerning this
interesting bird—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bubbola</span></span>, the Italians call him—which
relates how ages ago on the scorching plains
of Palestine a number of hoopoes once followed King
Solomon as he was riding, and in order to protect
the great king from the fierce rays of the sun, they
formed themselves into a living screen to shelter the
royal head. Grateful for this welcome attention,
Solomon Ben David at eventide sent for the king of
the Hoopoes to ask him what reward he would like
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg 35]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to receive for this service, and the answer was
promptly made that a crown of pure gold on the head
would be acceptable. The Jewish monarch smiled
grimly as he granted the request, whereupon immediately
each bird found his poll decorated with a tuft
of pure golden feathers, and mightily pleased with
their new magnificence were the conceited hoopoes.
But alas! the news was quickly spread abroad that
there were to be seen strange birds with plumes of
real gold, and the eternal lust of gain at once set men
in quest of the hoopoes, whom they began to slay
wholesale with stones, arrows, and traps in order to
obtain the coveted precious metal they bore on their
heads. In despair, the king of the hoopoes then flew
to the monarch sitting on his ivory throne at Jerusalem,
and begged him to change their golden crowns for
crests of feathers. Solomon the Wise smilingly gave
the order; at once lovely red and black feathers took
the place of the golden plumes, and the slaughter of
the hoopoes in Palestine forthwith ceased. And the
story, argues the recorder of this lesson upon the
folly of personal adornment, must of necessity be true,
for it is certain that the hoopoes bear a crown of
feathers upon their heads unto this day.

Slowly we toil up the last portion of the peak,

of the vast expanse of the Mediterranean, stretching
in one unbroken sheet of turquoise to the west, varied

innumerable ships, from the vast liners to the tiny

We descend by the slopes of Monte Faito in the
quiet of the evening, facing the distant headland of

see collecting thick masses of dark purple cloud,
which augur a stormy morrow. Above us the peak
of the Archangel is already wreathed in garlands of
white mist, a sure sign of coming tempest, and it is

Pompeii can never be visited without the same
haunting conviction, the same oppressive thought:
how terribly difficult it is to understand the City of
the Dead which holds in so small a space the whole
secret of the antique world! There are far more
grandiose and impressive ruins to be seen in Rome;
the city of Timgad in Northern Africa is more complete
as a specimen of a Roman settlement than the
half-excavated town near Vesuvius; yet here, and here
only, can the men of the past stretch hands, as it were,
across the barrier of eighteen intervening centuries to
the dweller of to-day, and the dead-and-gone spirits
of a highly organized civilization can whisper into the
living ears of the twentieth century. For Pompeii
will speak to us, if we will take the trouble to learn the
tongue in which alone she can convey the secret of
her story. It is needless to say that this language is
not obtainable by one or two cursory visits to the
Naples Museum, and a few hurried half-hours given to
the contents of the guide-book; no, the language of
Pompeii, which constitutes the key of access to the
hidden chambers of the Roman world, can only be
acquired with much expenditure of precious time and
with infinite trouble. But <span class="tei tei-q">“life is short and time is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg 39]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fleeting,”</span> and our bustling age expects to seize its
required knowledge in the twinkling of an eye; well,
in that case the story of Pompeii must remain a sealed
volume to the traveller, who is conveyed to the City
of the Dead in a train crammed with fellow-tourists;
who eats a heavy unwholesome luncheon to the sound
of mandoline-players twanging sprightly Neapolitan
airs; and who is finally piloted round the sacred area
by a chattering guide in the oppressive heat and glare
of a sunny afternoon. Fatigued in mind and body,
such an one will sink with ill-concealed relief upon the
dusty velvet cushions of the returning train, thoroughly
disappointed in the vaunted marvels of Pompeii, which
his imagination had led him to expect. A vague
impression of low broken walls, of narrow—to his eyes
absurdly narrow—streets, of broken columns and of
peeling frescoes fills his tired brain, as he is borne back
to his hotel in Naples. But this disenchantment is
his own fault, for no one who sets foot within the Sea
Gate of the buried city in the proper spirit of knowledge
and appreciation can possibly fail to enjoy the
privilege which has thus been afforded him—

Before passing through the Porta Marina into the
purlieus of the city, let us first of all instil into our
minds the essential difference that exists between the
ruins of Pompeii and the historic fragments of Rome
or Athens. When we gaze upon the well-known sites
of the vanished glories of the Palatine or the Acropolis,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg 40]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>we experience no effort in looking backward through
the vista of the past and in conjuring up some vague
representation of the scenes that were once enacted in
these places; the more imaginative feel the very air
vibrating with the unseen spirits of men and women
famous in the world’s history. He must be indeed a
Philistine or a dullard who cannot contrive to arouse
a passing exaltation at the thought of treading in the
footsteps of Cicero and the Caesars in Rome, of Pericles
and Socrates in Athens, for the very soil of the Forum
and the stones of the citadel of Pallas seem impregnated
with the very essence of history. But this is
far from being the case at Pompeii, where long careful
study of details and a grasp of hard facts are really of
more avail than a poetic imagination in reclothing
with flesh the dry bones of the past, for the importance
of the Campanian city is almost purely social. The
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">names</span></span> of many of its prominent citizens are certainly
familiar to us from inscriptions found, yet who were
these persons that we should take so deep an interest
in their lives and fates? Who were Pansa the ædile,
Eumachia the priestess, Caecilius Jucundus, Aulus
Vettius and Epidius Rufus, and a score of other
Pompeian worthies? The answer is, they were
officials or simple dwellers in a flourishing provincial
town; they had no especial literary or public reputation;
their names were probably little known beyond
the walls of their own city. Imagine an English
country town, such as Exeter or Shrewsbury, suddenly
overwhelmed by some unforeseen freak of Nature and
afterwards embalmed in the manner of Pompeii as a
curiosity for the edification of future ages. To what
extent, we ask, would the discovery of a place of this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page41">[pg 41]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>size and population supply the existing dweller with
a complete impression of our national life and civilization
in the opening years of the twentieth century?
The reply will be that it would give a very good idea
of the average provincial town, but that it would
hardly serve as a fair criterion to judge of the life
pursued in the capital, or in the really large cities.
Such a comparison will afford us a certain clue to the
unveiling of the mysteries of Pompeii.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the city at the mouth of the Sarno was an
ancient Campanian settlement, founded long before the
days wherein Greek adventurers beached their triremes
on the shores of the Siren. It was a native community
of Oscans, deriving its name from the Oscan word
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pompe</span></span> (five), and, unlike Paestum, it appears to have
retained its original appellation under all its successive
masters. Its primitive inhabitants seem to have intermingled
with their Hellenic victors, and to have grown
civilized by intercourse with them. Temples of heavy
Doric architecture were raised; walls and watch-towers
were built; and by the time the city fell into the
hands of the encroaching Romans, it had become a
flourishing place with some twenty to thirty thousand
inhabitants, owing its prosperity to its excellent situation
at the mouth of the river, which made Pompeii a
convenient port to serve the rich district of Campania
that lies eastward of Vesuvius. Nuceria (the modern
Nocera) and the larger city of Nola were both dependent
on it, for the Sarno was in those days navigable, so that
ships bringing Egyptian corn and Eastern merchandise
frequently left the Pompeian harbour and sailed up
stream to unload their cargoes at these cities. Let us
picture then to ourselves a compact town, an irregular
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page42">[pg 42]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>oval in form, surrounded by walls pierced by eight
gates and embellished with twelve towers; its eastern
extremity towards Nocera containing the Amphitheatre,
and its most westerly point marked by the Herculaneum
gate leading to the Street of Tombs. Southward, we
must imagine the sea much closer to its walls than at
the present day, for the alluvial deposits have in the
course of nearly two thousand years added many acres
of solid ground to the shores of the Bay. Behind the
city to the north rose the mountain side, not seared
with the traces of lava as in these days, nor surmounted
by a smoking cone, but radiant with vineyards and
gardens which extended unbroken up to the very rim
of the ancient crater. Amidst the greenery of the
luxuriant slopes peeped forth innumerable farms and
villas of wealthy Romans, for this exquisite spot had
long become an abode of cultured leisure. Within the
closely packed streets of the town itself there were to
be found few open spaces except the Forum, and
perhaps a small park in front of the amphitheatre, for
the place was prosperous, though not wealthy, and its
chief citizens were forced to remain content with the
tiny gardens enclosed within the walls of their own
dwellings.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Internally Pompeii presented, like many another
Roman town, marks of its six hundred years of existence.
There was at least one perfect Doric temple;
there were Oscan-Grecian buildings, notably the so-called
<span class="tei tei-q">“House of the Surgeon,”</span> with its air of
old-fashioned simplicity; there were houses of the
Republican period; there were numberless dwellings
of the Imperial era; there were unfinished structures
that were being completed at the time of the city’s
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page43">[pg 43]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>overthrow. For, sixteen years before Vesuvius suddenly
awoke from its long sleep, the neighbourhood
had been visited by the severe earthquake shock of
63, and the effects produced by this disaster had not
nearly been effaced, when the great event of 79 transformed
the town into a huge museum for the delight
and instruction of future generations. Pompeii therefore
preserves the marks of more than half a thousand
years of civilization, so that those who will take the
necessary trouble can trace within its area the gradual
progress of its social and political life from the far-off
days of Greeks and Oscans to the reign of the Emperor
Titus. The case of a ruined Exeter or Shrewsbury
could not be widely different. The students of ensuing
ages would be able to find in the dead town one or two
churches of Norman or Plantagenet times; portions of
medieval city walls and gateways, perhaps even some
undoubted traces of Roman baths or fortifications;
some few public buildings erected under Tudor or
Stuart sovereigns; a large number of the plain roomy
mansions of the Georgian period; and, last of all, a
preponderating quantity of nineteenth century structures
of every description—churches, warehouses, factories,
inns, barracks, shops, dwelling-houses. Many
would be the inscriptions and monuments we should
find in such a town, alluding to private and public
persons utterly unknown to English history, but more
or less noteworthy in local annals: grandees of civic
life, soldiers, philanthropists, clergymen, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et hoc genus
omne</span></span>. Future generations of scholars would doubtless
strive eagerly to obtain details of the careers of these
provincial worthies, who filled municipal offices in the
reigns of Queen Victoria and King Edward, in order
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page44">[pg 44]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to throw more light upon the period wherein they
flourished. Let us apply then the same principles to
the study of Pompeii <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mutatis mutandis</span></span>, for in our
quest of better knowledge of the old Roman life we
fix anxiously upon every detail concerning the leading
personages of the dead city. Nevertheless, it is its
existence in the aggregate that proves of surpassing
interest to us; we desire to learn of the daily tasks
and occupations of the mass of its population, rather
than to become acquainted with the private histories
of its leading individuals; we study the former, in
fact, only as a means to a definite end. We cry for
information, which to a certain extent we can secure,
as to how an average Roman city was administered,
provisioned, drained; how its inhabitants passed their
time both in leisure and in business; how they amused
themselves in their homes and in the theatre; what
they ate and what they drank—the endless trifles of
human life, in short, which like the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tesseræ</span></span>, the tiny
cubes of their own mosaic pavements, go to make up a
complete picture out of a thousand fragments. Not a
few of the cubes in this case are missing, it is true, nor
are they ever likely to be found; nevertheless, we own
an abundant supply wherewith we can piece together
a tolerably accurate picture of the life of a Roman
provincial city during the first century of the Christian
era.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is of course quite outside our province to attempt
any detailed account of the wonders of Pompeii. The
reader who desires full information must turn to the
elaborate works of Mau and Helbig, of Gell and
Overbeck, to say nothing of the descriptive pages,
full of condensed knowledge, contained in Murray’s
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg 45]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and Baedeker’s guide-books in order to obtain a clear
impression of all he wishes to inspect. We can but
dwell on a point here and there, and even then but
lightly and superficially, for any endeavour on our
part to add to the statements and theories of the
great archaeologists already cited would be indeed a
matter of supererogation and presumption.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Entering then by the Marine Gate, and pursuing
our course eastwards along the lines of naked broken
house-fronts, we reach the great rectangular space
of the Forum. Here at its southern extremity let us
select a shady corner, for the sun beats down fiercely
upon the bare ruins at every season of the year, and
even on a winter’s afternoon the air often shimmers
with the heat haze, so that in no place on earth is
the use of an umbrella so necessary or desirable as
at Pompeii.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What an ideal spot for the founding of a city!
That is our first impression, as we glance across the
broad sunlit enclosure on to the empurpled slopes
of Vesuvius rising grandly above the broken columns
of the great temple of the Capitoline Jove; behind
us, we know, is the azure Bay with Capri and the
Sorrentine cape lying on its unruffled bosom, so that
we stand between sea and mountain to north and south,
whilst we have the luxuriant slopes of Vesuvius to
westward, and to the east the rich valley of the Sarno,
thickly dotted with groves and hamlets. One element
alone is wanting in the glorious scene before us—Life;
it will be our duty and pleasure to re-invest as
far as possible this empty space before us with the
semblance of the busy crowds that once flitted in and
out of its colonnades and porticoes; to rebuild in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page46">[pg 46]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>imagination its shapeless ruins, so that we may
obtain a fleeting picture of the Pompeian Forum in
early Imperial days.

  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"></p><div class="tei tei-figure" style="width: 100%; text-align: center"><img src="images/illus04th.jpg" width="284" height="400" alt="Illustration: THE FORUM, POMPEII" title="THE FORUM, POMPEII" /><div class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.90em; margin-top: 0.90em"><a href="images/illus04.jpg" class="tei tei-xref" style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 90%">THE FORUM, POMPEII</span></a></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Conceive, then, in front of us, instead of this long
bare stretch flanked by broken walls and strewn with
shapeless fragments of brick and stone, an immense
double arcade, two stories in height, affording ample
protection against sun or rain and enclosing an oblong
pavement whereon are set numerous statues of
emperors or private citizens, occupying lofty positions
of honour above the heads of the surging throng
below. Imagine that group of shattered pillars,
which obstructs our full view of the distant cone of
Vesuvius, transformed into an imposing temple,
covered with polychrome decoration, not in the best
of taste according to our modern ideas of art, but
gorgeous and cheerful in the clear atmosphere of the
south. Rebuild, in the mind’s eye, the Basilica and
the temple of Apollo on the left, and straight before
us, as we look forward from our coign of vantage at
the narrow southern end of the colonnade, let us plant
the three dominant statues of Augustus, Claudius
and Agrippina to form our foreground. If we can construct
by stress of fancy some such setting of classical
architecture, gay with primary colours and gilding
and graceful in design, it is easier to people the Pompeian
Forum with the masses of humanity that once
mingled here. For we have the knowledge of modern
Italian life to guide us to a certain extent; we have
seen the swarms of citizens who to-day fill the main
piazzas of the towns, especially those of the provincial
type, where the morning market is held and the chief
cafés and shops are situated. But if the general use
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg 47]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the piazza is characteristic of the modern second-class
Italian city, this concentration of life was far
more marked in the ancient Roman town, wherein
the Forum must have appeared as the very heart of
the whole body social and politic. Roman city life
indeed displayed two strongly antagonistic phases:—the
utmost privacy in the home, the most public
exhibition in the Forum, where every trade and form
of business were carried on in the open air, and
whither pursuit of gain, or pleasure, or religious duty
led all the citizens to direct their steps. For, as we
have already shown, almost all the public life of the
place was concentrated within this space and its
surroundings; temples, markets, shops, law courts,
municipal offices, all abutted on the Forum; it was
not merely the chief, but the only place that drew
together the daily crowd, bent alike on business or
amusement. No chariots were permitted to cross the
area sacred to the claims of money-making, of gossip,
and of worship; so that we must picture to ourselves
a great mass of people undisturbed by the passing of
vehicles, or by the shouts and whip-crackings of the
noisy charioteers—was ever such a thing as a quiet
Italian coachman, ancient or modern, we digress to
wonder! All was orderly and decorous when compared
with the quarrelling, screaming groups of
citizens that block the congested streets of modern
Naples. Happily for us various paintings of the
Forum of Pompeii have been discovered, and these
are naturally of immense value in helping us to a
proper understanding of the habits and methods of
the people, and of the general appearance of the
Forum itself during its busiest hours. The costumes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page48">[pg 48]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of men, women and children; the articles of clothing
and of food ready for sale; the little knots of loiterers
or gossips; the citizens intent on reading the municipal
notices that are herein portrayed, all combine to
present us with an authentic picture of Pompeian and
therefore of Roman civic life. <span class="tei tei-q">“There is nothing new
under the sun,”</span> grumbled the Preacher many centuries
before the city under Vesuvius had reached its zenith
of civilization, and it must be confessed that the
general impression conveyed after studying the contemporary
pictures of antique life does not differ very
widely from that which we obtain by observing present
Italian conditions. For the frescoes in the Naples
Museum and in certain of the Pompeian houses seem
to recall strongly the scenes of the piazza, where all
the elements of society, irrespective of rank or station,
are still wont to congregate. Differences of dress, of
manner, of custom are doubtless evident enough, yet
somehow we perceive an essential sameness in these
two representations of classical and modern Italy.
Nevertheless, these simple and often rude wall-paintings
furnish us with many pieces of information
that we search for in vain amidst the ancient authors,
who naturally considered the commonplace everyday
scenes of life beneath the notice of contemporary
record. We are enabled to learn, for instance, how
the citizens were usually dressed in the Forum, and
how, in an age when hats and umbrellas were practically
non-existent, the pointed hood, like that of the
Arab burnous, was often used to cover the head in
cold or wet weather. Again, it is easy to perceive
from the same source that the diet of the Pompeians
must have resembled closely that of their present
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page49">[pg 49]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>descendants; even the shape of the loaves has in
most cases continued unchanged to the present day.
And one curious coincidence is certainly worth
mentioning, in that a peculiar method of preparing figs
with caraway seeds, which was long supposed to be a
local speciality of a remote town in Central Italy, has
now been recognized as a common method of dressing
this fruit for the table at Pompeii, for large quantities
of figs so treated have been unearthed in shops and
kitchens. Such grains of information as the wearing
of hoods and the preserving of figs may appear trifling
enough at first sight, yet it is from a number of petty
details such as these that we are assisted to an intimate
understanding of a state of society extinct nearly two
thousand years ago.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Close beside us on the eastern side of the Forum is
set the Chalcidicum, the large building of the priestess
Eumachia, one of the most gracious personalities of
Pompeii with which the modern world has become
acquainted. It was this lady who generously presented
this structure, one of the handsomest and most
solid of the public buildings of the city, to the fullers
to serve as their exchange, wherein goods might be
exposed upon benches and tables for the convenience
alike of sellers and purchasers. <span class="tei tei-q">“Priestess Eumachia,”</span>
remarks a modern critic, <span class="tei tei-q">“has done the thing well; no
expense has been spared in the building and its
decorations. The columns of the portico are of white
marble; the statues of Piety and Concord, works of
art; and the flower-borders along the panelled walls,
prettily conceived and carefully executed. After so
much plaster and stucco, it is a relief to see something
so solid and genuine. When a third-rate city apes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg 50]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the capital, there must needs be a certain amount of
sham. But at Pompeii it is all sham, or next door
to it. In the entire city are not more than half a
dozen edifices whose columns are of real marble, the bas-reliefs
and cornices of anything more solid than stucco;
and of these half-dozen, the Exchange heads the list.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We feel tolerably secure in assigning this fine
building to the early years of the Emperor Tiberius,
and in naming the Emperor’s mother, Livia, as the
divinity to whom it was dedicated. The statue of
Concord with the golden horn of plenty doubtless
once adorned the large pedestal which still stands in
the eastern apse of the Exchange, but though the
figure and emblem were those of Concordia, the face
bore certainly the features of Imperial Livia. Yet
more interesting than the various speculations as to
the actual uses of this edifice and the different names
of the statues which once embellished its alcoves,
is the circumstance that the marble portrait of the
foundress herself has been discovered. It is true that
only a copy in plaster now occupies the pedestal at
the back of the apse where Eumachia’s statue once
stood, for the original has been removed for safety to
Naples, but it is not difficult to call to mind the calm
gentle face of this Pompeian Lady Bountiful, and her
graceful figure in its flowing robes. The existence of
this statue adds undoubtedly a touch of special human
interest to the whole building, and we find our minds
excited by the brief inscription which still informs
the curious that the fullers of Pompeii erected
this portrait in marble in grateful appreciation <span class="tei tei-q">“to
Eumachia, a city-priestess, daughter of Lucius
Eumachius.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page51">[pg 51]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Outside the Chalcidicum, at the corner of the lane
usually termed Via dell’ Abbondanza, is to be seen
a pathetic little memorial of the working life of the
city: the fountain of Concordia Augusta, the divinity
of Eumachia’s noble building hard by. Dusty and
heating is the business of fulling cloth, and it generates
thirst, so that it is but natural to find a fountain close
at hand, whereat the labourers could refresh their
parched throats. With what eagerness must the
exhausted toilers during those long summers of
centuries past have leaned forward to press their
human lips to the cool mouth of the sculptured
goddess that ejected with pleasing gurgles a volume
of water into the basin below! That this fountain
proved a boon to weary citizens is evident enough,
for the features of water-spouting Concordia are half
worn away by thirsty human kisses, and her suppliants’
hands have left deep smooth furrows in the stone-work
of the basin, whereon they were wont to support
their bodies, so as to direct the cooling draught into
the dry and dusty gullet. In Italian cities to-day we
can frequently observe some exhausted labourer bend
deftly downwards to snatch a drink of water from the
mouth of some fantastic figure in a public fountain.
Who has not paused, for instance, beside Tacca’s
famous bronze boar in the Florentine market-place
without noting an incident of this kind? If we ourselves
are too dainty to place our own aristocratic
lips where our fellow-mortals have pressed theirs,
not so are the abstemious descendants of the ancient
Romans, the Italians, whose minds remain untroubled
by any nasty-nice qualms of possible infection.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here then is the setting of the picture, and we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page52">[pg 52]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>must ourselves endeavour to repeople the empty
space with the crowds of high and low that once
collected here.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is high change, and the Forum is crowded.
All Pompeii is here, and his wife. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patres conscripti</span></span>,
inclined to corpulence, taking their constitutional,
exquisites lazily sauntering up and down the pavements;
decurions discussing the affairs of the nation,
and the last news from Rome; city magnates fussing,
merchants chaffering, clients petitioning, parasites
fawning, soldiers swaggering, and Belisarius begging
at the gate.... It is a bright and animated scene.
Beneath, the crowded Forum, with its colonnades and
statues, at one end a broad flight of steps leading
to the Temple of Jupiter, at the other a triumphal
arch; on one side the Temple of Venus and the
Basilica; on the other the Macellum, the Temple of
Mercury, the Chalcidicum; overhead the deep blue
sky. Mingled with the hum of many voices and
the patter of feet on the travertine pavement are the
ringing sounds of the stonemasons’ chisels and
hammers, for the Forum is undergoing a complete
restoration. Although fifteen years have elapsed
since the city was last visited by earthquake, the
damage then done to the public buildings has not
been entirely repaired. First the Gods, then the
people. The temples of Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury
are completed, but the Forum and Chalcidicum are
still in the workmen’s hands.”</span><a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With this fleeting glimpse at the public life of the
city, let us now turn our attention to its domestic
arrangements. Of the many houses which have been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg 53]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>excavated of recent years under the truly admirable
superintendence of Signor Fiorelli, none is better
calculated to give us a striking impression of the
working details of an upper-class Roman household
than the private dwelling which is known equally
under the two names of the Casa Nuova and the
House of the Vettii;—perhaps the former name has
now ceased to own any significance, since the buildings
were laid bare as far back as the winter of
1894-5. An hour or two spent in a careful inspection
of this house and its contents is to most persons
worth four times the same amount of time occupied
in aimless wandering amongst the hot glaring streets
of the city, peeping into this courtyard and that, and
listening to the interminable tales of guide or
custodian. If we study the Casa Nuova intelligently,
lovingly and minutely, it will not be long before we
obtain a tolerable grasp of Roman life and manners,
which will prove of immense service and of genuine
delight. What then is it, the question will be asked,
that makes the House of the Vettii so valuable as
an example of antique architecture and decoration,
in preference to other mansions which can boast an
equal and often a greater distinction? The answer
is simple enough: it is because this particular group
of buildings has been allowed to remain as far as
practicable in the exact condition wherein it was
originally unearthed, when its various rooms and
courts were once more exposed to the light of day.
For until the clearing of this <span class="tei tei-q">“new house”</span> a decade
or so ago, no proper opportunity had so far been
afforded to the amateur of our own times of judging
for himself the interior of a Roman dwelling in full
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg 54]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>working order, and with all its furniture, paintings,
and utensils complete. Up to this, almost every
object of value had been removed at once for safety,
every fresco even of importance had been cut bodily
out of its setting and placed in one of those immense
halls on the ground floor of the Museum in Naples.
How well do we remember those gaunt chilly
chambers, filled from pavement to ceiling with painted
fragments of all sizes, a medley of domestic subjects
and of classical myths! Torn from the walls they
were specially executed to adorn, divorced from their
proper scheme of surrounding ornament, these wan
dejected ghosts stare at us like faces out of a mist.
The uninitiated cannot find pleasure in them, for they
have no pretention to be called works of art; on the
contrary they form an inherent part of a conventional
system of house decoration. The classical student can
of course find many points of interest in the incidents
portrayed, but all charm of local environment is
absent;—it is, in short, impossible to judge of Roman
decoration from this collection of crumbling, fading
pieces of painted stucco. It would be as easy to
imagine the effect of a rose-bush in full bloom from
the sight of a few withered rose-buds, pressed until
every vestige of colour had left their petals, as to
understand the significance of antique domestic art
from the contents of the Museo Nazionale.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But here, in the House of the Vettii, the public was
for the first time initiated into the mysteries of true
Roman life; here it was admitted to gaze upon the
fruits of classical taste and refinement, and to contrast
them, favourably or unfavourably, with prevailing
modern standards. The Casa Nuova has been left
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page55">[pg 55]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as an object lesson, a complete museum in itself,
wherein every daily incident of Pompeian life, every
domestic secret, reveal themselves to our inquisitive
eyes. Here in the roofless halls we can be taken from
entrance to dining-hall, from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">atrium</span></span> to sleeping rooms,
spying into the minutest detail of shape, size and
colour, as though we were seriously intending to rent
the house for our own habitation. The last tenant
has even left his money-chest in his hall, his pots and
pans in the kitchen, and as we inspect his utensils, we
wonder if they would suit our own requirements to-day.
Of portable objects of value—plate, jewels, statuettes
of precious metals and the like—belonging to the late
owner, there is certainly no trace, for Signor Fiorelli’s
labourers were not the first to break the deep silence
of this buried mansion. For it was the survivors of
the stricken town, the citizens of Pompeii themselves,
who were the foremost pioneers to excavate, and they
carried off every work of art they could conveniently
remove. Cutting from above into the deposit of ashes
that filled the streets, they managed to reach in course
of time the level of the ground, after which they
tunnelled from room to room, from house to house,
collecting every object they thought worth the trouble
of transporting. Perhaps the owners of the house, the
Vettii themselves, presuming they escaped in the general
<a name="corr055" id="corr055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">catastrophe</span>, may have returned with skilled workmen
to recover some of their treasures; perhaps some <span class="tei tei-q">“man
of three letters”</span>—the colloquial Roman term for thief
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fur</span></span>)—may have forestalled the masters’ efforts—who
knows? And at this distance of time, who cares?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The house once occupied by Aulus Vettius Restitutus
and Aulus Vettius Corvina stands in a quiet district
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page56">[pg 56]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>not far from the Capuan Gate, and consequently at
some distance from the Forum. Like all Roman
habitations it was essentially Oriental in its outward
aspect, and must have resembled closely any one of
those mysterious dwellings of wealthy Arab citizens
which we constantly encounter in the native quarters
of Algiers or Tunis. The gateway giving on the
street was wide, certainly, but it was well defended
both by human and canine porters; its windows were
few and small, and were probably closely latticed like
those of the nunneries which we sometimes perceive
overhead in the crowded streets of Naples. There
must have been something austere, even suspicious, in
the external appearance of the Casa de’ Vettii, but
snarling dog and grim janitor have long since disappeared,
and we pass unmolested through the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">atrium</span></span>
and thence into the Great Peristyle, which is perhaps
the most remarkable feature of this house. The
peristyle, as its name implies, is a Greek importation
in a Roman city, and its use would have been scorned
by the old-fashioned citizens, such as the master of
the <span class="tei tei-q">“House of the Surgeon”</span>; yet it was in truth
admirably suited to the character of Southern Italy,
where it afforded shelter from sun and wind, and its
arcades protected from the rainfall. The peristyle of
the Vettii, with its gaudily tinted pillars of stucco, is
highly ornate; perhaps it passes the limits of good
taste in certain points of colour and æsthetic decoration,
yet the general effect is undoubtedly pleasing to the
eye. This courtyard is at once a lounge open to the
sky; it is a garden; it is an art-gallery; for the
cheerful court of Greek domestic architecture had
nothing in common with its successor of the Middle
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page57">[pg 57]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Ages, the monastic cloister of religious meditation.
Cannot we imagine to ourselves the goodman of the
house proudly leading his guests after a sumptuous
meal in the adjacent dining-room into the cool corridors
of his peristyle, in order to point out to them his
statues and vases of bronze or porphyry, and to
expatiate upon their value or elegance of form? On
such a festive occasion these great shallow basins of
pure white marble before us would be heaped high
with fragrant pyramids of red and white roses, roses
that were perhaps plucked all dewy in the famous
gardens of Paestum on the other side of Mons
Gaurus. For the flowering shrubs in the tiny
pleasaunce itself are far too precious to be stripped
of their blossoms in so lavish a manner, and perhaps
if Vettius be anything of an amateur gardener, he
may comment to his visitors upon the rare plants that
fill his diminutive flower-beds. Careful and reverent
hands have restored the little garden as near as
possible to its pristine plan and appearance. There
are still standing the two bronze statues of urchins
holding in their chubby arms ducks from whose bills
once gushed the limpid water, making a soothing
sound amidst the alleys of the peristyle; corroded
and injured they certainly appear, yet here they
hold their original positions in Vettius’ domain long
after temple and tower have fallen to the ground.
The marble chairs and tripod tables likewise remain,
and around them still thrive the very plants that the
servants of the house were wont to tend in the days
of Titus. For, by a rare chance, we find depicted
on the walls of the excavated house the actual flowers
and herbs that were popular during Vettius’ lifetime,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page58">[pg 58]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and these have been replanted by modern hands in
the garden of the peristyle. There are clumps of
papyrus, the strange mop-headed rush from the banks
of the Nile, introduced into Italy as a botanical
novelty after the conquest of Egypt; there are rose-bushes,
of course; and also masses of shining ivy
trained in the ancient Roman manner upon a cage
of wicker-work fixed into the soil. As we watch the
verdure-clad sunlit space there descends, delicately
fluttering, one of those splendid pale yellow brimstone
butterflies of the South with flame-coloured blushes
on its wings, and after some moments of graceful
hesitation, this new visitor settles upon the purple
head of an iris bloom. With its vivid colouring and
its quick movements the butterfly brings an atmosphere
of life into the courtyard that was hitherto lacking.
Its appearance too suggests the famous allegory, the
unsolved riddle of human existence which so puzzled
the divine Plato and the ancient philosophers of
Athens and Syracuse. Here are we, the living
men of to-day, watching the corpse of a departed
world upon which the mystic symbol of Psyche has
just alighted. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tempus breve est</span></span> is the simple little
truism that rises to our reflecting minds. Eighteen
centuries between the Vettii and ourselves! They
are gone like a flash, and we are amazed to note
how little has our nature altered either for the better
or the worse within that space of time, long enough
if we measure its limit by the standard of history,
trivial if we reckon it by the progress made in human
ethics and human understanding. Surely there are
lessons to be learned in the silent city; Pompeii, we
realize, is not merely a heap of antique dross whence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page59">[pg 59]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>we can pick up precious grains of knowledge, but
it is an oracle in itself, which, if properly consulted,
will give us plain answers to our modern speculations,
and will possibly reprove us for our conceited
assumption of omniscience.

Still brilliant in their strong prevailing tints of black,
yellow and vermilion are the decorative schemes which
make a visit to the house of the Vettii of such supreme
importance for those who wish to understand fully the
artistic tastes of the Romans, and also their artistic
limitations. If the contents of the Museum seem
colourless and cold, and prove unsatisfying and disappointing,
here the eye of the artist can feast upon
the classical ornamentation which remains fairly fresh
in spite of a dozen years of exposure to daylight.
For this province of art is peculiarly associated with
the opening years of the Empire, and Pompeii is
naturally the chief place for its study, and in Pompeii
the untouched Casa Nuova is all important for the
student. According to Pliny, the inventor of this
pleasing style of decoration was a certain Ludius, who
flourished in the reign of Augustus, and first persuaded
the Romans to embellish their flat wall-surfaces with
designs of <span class="tei tei-q">“villas and halls, artificial gardens, hedges,
woods, hills, water basins, tombs, rivers, shores, in as
great a variety as could be desired; figures sitting
at ease, mariners, and those who, riding upon donkeys
or in waggons, look after their farms; fishermen,
snarers of birds, hunters and vine-dressers; also
swampy passages before beautiful villas, and women
borne by men who stagger under their burdens, and
other witty things of this nature; finally, views of sea-ports,
everything charming and suitable”</span>:—a fairly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page60">[pg 60]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>long and comprehensive list of subjects, truly, from
which a patron might pick and choose, or an artist
might execute!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although the great architect Vitruvius strongly
denounced this new striving after scenic effect and
characterized it as petty and false, yet none can deny
that these cheerful scenes with their bright colours and
their agreeable if trivial subjects were singularly well
adapted to improve the appearance of the bare narrow
rooms, the meagre proportions of which seem to us
absolutely incompatible with plain comfort, to say
nothing of luxury. Space may be increased, so far
as the eye is concerned, by an architectural or
landscape painting ingeniously conceived, and thus
the restricted rooms seem to obtain by means of
this new system of decoration a wider expansion, and
with it an increased sense of ease and lightness. The
invention of Ludius became at once the fashion, the
rage; and all Rome began to cover the walls of its
narrow chambers with these novel designs, which had
already found favour in Imperial circles. Campania,
where the old Greek love for polychrome still lingered,
was not slow in imitating the new taste of the
Capital, so that Pompeii bears undoubted testimony
to the popularity of this revolution in artistic ideas,
which substituted a lighter freer method for the old
conventional severity of treatment. Experts profess
to trace—and none will endeavour to gainsay them—a
marked difference between the frescoes executed
before the earthquake of 63 and those undertaken
subsequent to that date. The wall paintings of the
first group, carried out when the art was comparatively
novel, are superior in harmony of colour, in choice
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page61">[pg 61]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of themes and in technical finish to those which belong
to the latter period, the sixteen years that intervened
between the earthquake and the eruption of Vesuvius.
From this circumstance it has been inferred, not
without reason, that this particular house must have
passed some time before the year 63 out of the
possession of people of good taste into the hands of
vulgarians, ignorant of the fundamental principles of
art and anxious only to obtain what was startling
and garish. As freedmen, the two Vettii would
naturally belong to a class which was not remarkable
for culture; nevertheless, they seem to have had the
good sense to leave intact some of their predecessor’s
most cherished works of decoration, and for this
exhibition of restraint we must feel duly grateful
towards our dead-and-gone hosts, the maligned Vettii.

But it is not only for purposes of examining Roman
internal decoration <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in situ</span></span> that this art gallery of the
Casa Nuova is available. Below the painted panels
of the dining-room runs a long string of ornament,
whereon are represented Cupids and Psyches engaged
in the various occupations of Pompeian daily life.
Full of dainty grace and of lively expression, these
little winged figures initiate us into a number of the
trades and customs of the ancients. For they are
made to appear before us as goldsmiths, vine-dressers,
makers and sellers of olive oil, dealers in wine, fullers
of cloth, and as partakers in a dozen other scenes
of town or country life. Where learned antiquaries
had hitherto doubted and disputed, the discovery of
the paintings of these celestial little mechanics and
merchants helped to solve many a difficulty, for the
secret of half the arts and crafts of Pompeii is revealed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page62">[pg 62]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to us in this playful guise. Nor are the designs
themselves contemptible from an artistic point of
view; look how intent, for example, is the pose of
the tiny jeweller working with a graver’s tool upon
the gold vessel before him; how steadily he bears
himself at a task which requires at once strength of
hand and delicacy of workmanship. Look again at
the nervous pose of the pretty elf who is gingerly
pouring wine out of a huge amphora, which he holds
in his arms, into a shallow tasting cup offered by a
brother Cupid. How thoroughly must the unknown
artist have enjoyed the task of painting this frieze!
How unfettered his fancy, as his brush glided smoothly
and deftly over the carefully prepared wall-surface!
Excellent, no doubt, he thought his work at the time
of execution, but even the most conceited of Campanian
artists could hardly have dreamed that these creations
of his brush would still at the end of two thousand
years be admired, commented upon and even reproduced
in thousands, by a process he never dreamed
of, for the benefit of citizens of nations as yet unborn
or unforeseen.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the spring evening softly steals over the city
and the shadows of the colonnades lengthen, let us
leave the silent halls and chambers of the Casa dei
Vettii and turn our footsteps westward; and issuing
out of the Gate of Herculaneum, let us traverse the
famous Street of Tombs, that extends along the road
leading to the sister buried city. In ancient times
this was the Via Domitiana, a branch road of the
Appian Way, and it formed the most frequented
entrance into Pompeii. To Roman ideas, therefore,
it was but natural that tombs should be erected
along<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page63">[pg 63]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>side its borders, whilst the spirits of the passing and
repassing crowds were in no wise affected by the
memorials of death attending their exits and entrances.
And with the surging human tide that was
ever flowing in this thoroughfare the funeral processions
must constantly have mingled, the wailing
of the hired mourners rising sharply above the din of
harsh voices, the creaking of clumsy wooden wheels
and the braying of the heavily laden asses. Now over
all reigns a decorous silence, such as we moderns deem
fitting for a cemetery; only the hum of insects breaks
the deep quiet of the atmosphere, nor are there any
living creatures visible at this late hour save the bats
which flit restlessly in and out of the weed-grown piles
of brick or stone that once were stately monuments
of wealth or piety. Above our heads the tall sombre
cypresses shoot upward like gigantic spear-heads into
the crystal-clear air, pointing heavenward like our
own church spires in a rural English landscape. This
Street of the Dead in the City of the Dead is in truth
a solemn and a soothing spot; nor can we find its
precincts melancholy, when we stand in the midst of
such glorious scenery. For Monte Sant’ Angelo
towers to our left against the mellow evening sky,
flecked with lines of peach-blossom cloud, whilst in
front of us the dark form of Capri seems to float in a
golden haze between firmament and ocean. Behind
us the dark mass of the Mountain with its breath of
ascending smoke seems like an eternal funeral pyre in
honour of the Dead, who were spared the horrors of
that fearful disaster which overwhelmed the living.
Upon the broken tombs and altars the light from the
setting sun falls with warm cheerful radiance, flushing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page64">[pg 64]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>stone and brick-work with a ruddy glow like jasper;
whilst, high in the heavens above the cypress tops,
the crescent moon prepares to turn to gold from
silver.

Mammia, the decemvir Aricius, Libella the aedile, and

wooden pyres flung up in these precincts their clouds
of perfumed smoke into the clear air, now redolent
with the aroma of yellow broom, of dewy thyme and
of sweet marigolds! Perhaps it was amidst these
lines of cypress-set tombs by the Herculaneum Gate
that the poetic genius, whose verses were spurned by
his own generation, composed his famous Ode to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first appearance of Vesuvius, whether viewed
from the deck of a steamer entering the Bay of
Naples or espied from the window of a railway
carriage on the main line running southward from
Rome, makes an impression that will linger for ever
in the memory. It is open to argument which is the
more striking of the two experiences: the Mountain
rising proudly from the deep blue waters into the
paler shade of the upper air, or its graceful broken
contour seen from the landward side to the north
across the green fertile plains of the Campagna Felice.
From a long acquaintance with both ways of
approaching Naples, we are inclined to prefer the
latter view. Travelling in an express train from
Rome we find ourselves whirled suddenly, by magic
as it were, into the atmosphere of the South, when
with the sight of the domes and towers of Capua, the
ancient capital of Campania the Prosperous, we first
note the presence of orange trees and hedges of aloe,
of white lupin crops and clumps of prickly pear, and
we feel we are nearing Naples with <span class="tei tei-q">“its burning
mountain and its tideless sea,”</span> so that we eagerly
strain our eyes in a southerly direction to catch our
first glimpse of Vesuvius, with whose shape and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page67">[pg 67]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>history we have been so familiar since our childhood’s
days. At length we perceive its double summit, with
smoke tranquilly issuing from the cone and obscuring
the clarity of the air, and as we hurry forward towards
our destination, through the plains studded with elm-trees
festooned with vines, we have the satisfaction of
observing its form grow larger and more distinct in
outline.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On our arrival at Naples, in course of time we grow
more intimately acquainted with the peculiar attractions
of <span class="tei tei-q">“the Mountain,”</span> as the Neapolitans always
designate their treacherous but fascinating neighbour,
of whose near existence they have every reason to be
proud, for certainly Vesuvius, though barely as lofty
as Ben Nevis, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></span> to us westerns the most famous
mountain upon earth. Regarding Vesuvius both from
the land and the sea, we note that it rises in solitary
majesty from an extended base some thirty miles in
circumference, and that it sweeps upwards in graceful
curving lines until at a distance of about 3000 feet
from sea level its summit is cleft into two peaks;
that to the north being a rocky ridge which catches
our eye as we gaze eastward from the heights of Sant’
Elmo or the Corso at Naples, the other point being
the actual cone of the volcano itself. The upper part
of the Mountain has in fact two aspects; in other
words, Vesuvius is double, being composed of the ridge
of Monte Somma to the north, 3760 feet in height,
which is pre-historic; and the ever-shifting modern
dome of Vesuvius to the south, which is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">about</span></span> 4000
feet high. We say <span class="tei tei-q">“about”</span> purposely, for Vesuvius
proper sometimes over-tops, sometimes equals, and
sometimes even crouches under its immovable
sister-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page68">[pg 68]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>peak, according to the effect produced by volcanic
action. Monte Somma, which is one of the everlasting
hills, is the parent, and Vesuvius is the child, born
but yesterday from a geological point of view, for it
is not so old as the Christian era;—<span class="tei tei-q">“it is a variable
heap thrown up from time to time, and again, not
seldom, by a greater effort of the same force, tossed
away into the air, and scattered in clouds of dust over
far-away countries. Thus it has happened often, in
the course of these variations of energy, that Vesuvius
has risen to a conical height exceeding that of Somma
by 500 or 600 feet, and again, the top has been
truncated to a level as low as Somma, or even as
much below that mountain as we now behold it
above.”</span><a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To understand the story of the Mountain, therefore,
it is necessary for us to travel back in retrospect
to ancient Roman days. In the first place, however,
one word as to its present name that we use to-day,
for all are familiar with Vesuvius, but comparatively
few, until they visit Naples, have heard mention made
of Monte Somma. The name of Vesuvius, then,
though strictly applicable only to the volcanic and
modern portion of the Mountain, is not a recent
appellation; on the contrary, it is probably of far more
ancient origin than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mons Summanus</span></span> by which the
whole was known to the Romans. The point is by
no means unimportant, for etymologists derive
Vesuvius from the Syriac <span class="tei tei-q">“Vo Seevev, the abode of
flame,”</span> thereby proving to us that whatever opinions
may have been held as to the nature of the Mountain
in the century preceding the Christian era, its volcanic
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg 69]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>nature must have been perfectly well understood
by those who gave it this suggestive title in a more
remote age. But the secret locked up in Mons
Summanus was not altogether unsuspected by the
Roman scientists. Strabo, the geographer, writing
about thirty years before the birth of Christ, made a
careful examination of the crest of Mons Summanus,
then a saucer-shaped hollow surrounded by a steep
rocky edge and occupied by a flat plain covered with
cinders and void of grass, although the flanks of
the Mountain were extraordinarily fertile. From what
he saw during his visit, Strabo conjectured the
Mountain to be an extinct volcano, in which surmise
he was destined to be proved partly in the right and
partly in the wrong; whilst Vitruvius, the famous
architect of the Emperor Augustus, <span class="tei tei-q">“who found Rome
of brick and left it of marble,”</span> as well as Tacitus the
historian, shared the same opinion. About a century
and a half before the first recorded eruption in 79,
Mons Summanus figures prominently in Roman
history as the scene of a curious incident during
the Servile War, so that in the pages of the old
chronicler Florus we obtain an interesting description—especially
interesting because it was not given for
scientific purposes—of the condition of the mountain
top at that period. The brave gladiator Spartacus
and his intrepid band of revolted slaves, seeking
a place of safety from the pursuing Roman legions,
not very wisely selected the top of this isolated peak,
which, although affording a good position of defence
and possessing a wide outlook over the Campanian
plain, had only one narrow passage in its rocky rim
to serve as entrance or outlet. Followed hither by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page70">[pg 70]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Roman forces and caught like rats in a trap, Spartacus
and his men were doomed either to be reduced
by starvation, or else to run the gauntlet of the sole
narrow exit, which the Senate’s commander, Clodius
Glabrus, was already guarding. The story of
Spartacus’ escape from his terrible dilemma is told
in the history of Florus, and repeated with further
details by Plutarch in his Life of Crassus.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Clodius the Prætor, with three thousand men,
besieged them in a mountain, having but one narrow
and difficult passage, which Clodius kept guarded; all
the rest was encompassed with broken and slippery
precipices, but upon the top grew a great many wild
vines: they cast down as many of these boughs
as they had need of, and twisted them into ladders
long enough to reach from thence to the bottom,
by which, without any danger, all got down save
one, who stayed behind to throw them their arms,
after which he saved himself with the rest.”</span>

A dozen learned statements of a scientific nature as
to the ancient appearance and slumbering condition of
the Mountain could not impress our imagination more
vividly with its subsequent natural changes than
the account of this episode of Spartacus and his handful
of rebels, beleaguered by Clodius within the
very crater of the volcano. We can see the Mountain
in the last years of the Roman Republic before us,
with its truncated cone encircled by a low rampart
of rock half hidden by wild vine, ivy, eglantine,
honeysuckle and all the creeping plants whose tough
trailing stems enabled the besieged gladiators to effect
their escape from the snare into which they had unwittingly
fallen. We can understand from this event
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page71">[pg 71]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>how utterly remote was the idea of any upheaval of
nature to the dwellers on these shores, whose ancestors
remembered the crest of the mountain as the scene of
a military operation.

The first warning of a coming eruption after
unnumbered centuries of quiet was given by a series
of earthquakes which did an immense amount of
damage at Herculaneum and Pompeii; yet in a
district which had from time immemorial been subject
to similar convulsions of nature, the shocks, though
unusually distressing and destructive to life and
property, were evidently unconnected in the popular
mind with their true cause: the reawakening to life
of the mountain overhead. The mischief done by the
earthquakes was accordingly repaired as quickly as
possible, and the normal course of life was resumed
until the terrific and wholly unexpected outbreak of
August 24th 79, during the reign of the Emperor
Titus. Of this, the first recorded eruption of Vesuvius,
we are exceptionally fortunate in possessing the
testimony of a credible eye-witness, who was no less
a personage than Caius Plinius Caecilius Secundus,
better known to the modern world as Pliny the
Younger, who wrote two lengthy letters to Tacitus
on the subject of this event, the first describing the
fate of his uncle, the Elder Pliny, most eminent of
Roman naturalists, who perished during this period of
terror; and the second containing a more detailed
account of the eruption itself. For it so happened—luckily
for posterity—that at the time of this sudden
outburst of Mons Summanus, the Elder Pliny was in
command of the Roman fleet at Misenum on the Bay
of Naples, where his young nephew (who was also his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg 72]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>adopted son) was living with his mother in a villa.
<span class="tei tei-q">“On the 24th of August,”</span> writes Pliny the Younger
some eleven years after the event he is about to
describe, <span class="tei tei-q">“about one in the afternoon, my mother
desired my uncle to observe a cloud which appeared
of a very unusual size and shape. He had just
returned from taking the benefit of the sun, and after
bathing himself in cold water, and taking a slight
repast, was retired to his study. He immediately
arose and went out upon an eminence, from whence
he might more distinctly view this very uncommon
appearance. It was not at that distance discernible
from what mountain this cloud issued, but it was found
afterwards to ascend from Mount Vesuvius. I cannot
give a more exact description of its figure than by
resembling it to that of a pine-tree, for it shot up to
a great height in the form of a trunk, which extended
itself on the top into a sort of branches, occasioned, I
imagine, either by a sudden gust of air that impelled
it, the force of which decreased as it advanced upwards,
or the cloud itself being pressed back again by its own
weight, expanded in this manner; it appeared sometimes
bright, and sometimes dark and spotted, as it
was more or less impregnated with earth and cinders.
This extraordinary phenomenon excited my uncle’s
philosophical curiosity to take a nearer view of it.”</span>
The nephew then proceeds to relate how his uncle
sailed by way of Retina, the port of Herculaneum, to
Stabiae, where he met with his second in command,
one Pomponianus. Meanwhile the Younger Pliny,
who had declined to accompany his uncle’s expedition
on the plea of having to pursue the studies with which
as a hard-working youth of seventeen he was evidently
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page73">[pg 73]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>engrossed, became alarmed during the night for the
Elder Pliny’s safety. His own and his mother’s
terrible experiences are vividly portrayed in the second
letter, which, at the historian’s special request, the
Younger Pliny wrote to Tacitus in later years.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“When my uncle had started, I spent such time as
was left on my studies—it was on their account,
indeed, that I had stopped behind. Then followed
the bath, dinner and sleep, this last disturbed and
brief. There had been noticed for many days before
a trembling of the earth, which had caused, however,
but little fear, because it is not unusual in Campania.
But that night it was so violent, that one thought
everything was being not merely moved, but absolutely
overturned. My mother rushed into my chamber; I
was in the act of rising, with the same intention of
awaking her, should she have been asleep. We sat
down in the open court of the house, which occupied
a small space between the buildings and the sea.
And now—I do not know whether to call it courage
or folly, for I was but in my eighteenth year—I called
for a volume of Livy, read it as if I were perfectly at
leisure, and even continued to make some extracts
which I had begun. Just then arrived a friend of my
uncle, who had lately come to him from Spain; when
he saw that we were sitting down—that I was even
reading—he rebuked my mother for her patience, and
me for my blindness to the danger. Still I bent
myself as industriously as ever over my book. It was
now seven o’clock in the morning, but the daylight
was still faint and doubtful. The surrounding buildings
were now so shattered, that in the place where we
were, which though open was small, the danger that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page74">[pg 74]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>they might fall on us was imminent and unmistakable.
So we at last determined to quit the town. A panic-stricken
crowd followed us.... We saw the sea retire
into itself, seeming, as it were, to be driven back by
the trembling movement of the earth. The shore had
distinctly advanced, and many marine animals were
left high and dry upon the sands. Behind us was a
dark and dreadful cloud, which, as it was broken with
rapid zig-zag flashes, revealed behind it variously shaped
masses of flame; these last were like sheet lightning,
though on a larger scale.... It was not long before
the cloud that we saw began to descend upon the
earth and cover the sea. It had already surrounded
and concealed the island of Capreae, and had made
invisible the promontory of Misenum. My mother
besought, urged, even commanded me to fly as best I
could; <span class="tei tei-q">‘I might do so,’</span> she said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘for I was young;
she, from age and corpulence, could move but slowly,
but would be content to die, if she did not bring death
upon me.’</span> I replied that I would not seek safety
except in her company; I clasped her hand and
compelled her to go with me. She reluctantly obeyed,
but continually reproached herself for delaying me.
Ashes now began to fall—still, however, in small
quantities. I looked behind me; a dense dark mist
seemed to be following us, spreading itself over the
country like a cloud. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Let us turn out of the way,’</span>
I said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘whilst we can still see, for fear that, should we
fall in the road, we should be trodden under foot in
the darkness by the throngs that accompany us.’</span> We
had scarcely sat down when night was upon us,—not
such as we have seen when there is no moon, or when
the sky is cloudy, but such as there is in some closed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page75">[pg 75]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>room where the lights are extinguished. You might
hear the shrieks of women, the monotonous wailing of
children, the shouts of men. Many were raising their
voices, and seeking to recognise by the voices that
replied, parents, children, husbands or wives. Some
were loudly lamenting their own fate, others the fate
of those dear to them. Some even prayed for death,
in their fear of what they prayed for. Many lifted
their hands in prayer to the gods; more were convinced
that there were now no gods at all, and that
the final endless night of which we have heard had
come upon the world.... It now grew somewhat
light again; we felt sure that this was not the light of
day, but a proof that fire was approaching us. Fire
there was, but it stopped at a considerable distance
from us; then came darkness again, and a thick, heavy
fall of ashes. Again and again we stood up and
shook them off; otherwise, we should have been
covered by them, and even crushed by the weight.
At last the black mist I had spoken of seemed to
shade off into smoke or cloud, and broke away. Then
came genuine daylight, and the sun shone out with a
lurid light, such as it is wont to have in an eclipse. Our
eyes, which had not yet recovered from the effects of
fear, saw everything changed, everything covered deep
with ashes as if with snow. We returned to Misenum,
and after refreshing ourselves as best we could, spent
a night of anxiety in mingled hope and fear. Fear,
however, was still the stronger feeling; for the
trembling of the earth continued, while many frenzied
persons, with their terrific predictions, gave an exaggeration
that was even ludicrous to the calamities
of themselves and of their friends. Even then, in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page76">[pg 76]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>spite of all the perils which we had experienced, and
which we still expected, we had not a thought of
going away till we could hear news of my uncle.”</span><a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a>

As to the fate of the Elder Pliny, it seems that
the old man had been obliged together with his friends
and servants to fly from the villa at Stabiae where he
was resting. The sea being too agitated to allow
of an embarkation, the fugitives turned their steps
towards the slopes of Mons Gaurus, the present
Monte Sant’ Angelo, with pillows bound over their
heads to serve as protection against the showers of
hot cinders that were falling thickly on all sides.
At length the famous old writer, who was somewhat
plethoric and unwieldy, sank exhausted to the ground,
never to rise again, and shortly expired in an attack
of heart failure, induced by the unusual excitement
and fatigue he had lately been called upon to endure.
At any rate, it appears fairly certain that the Elder
Pliny did not perish, as is still sometimes asserted,
by the direct effects of the eruption, but rather
through an ordinary collapse of nature—syncope,
perhaps. Three days later his body was found lying
not far from Stabiae by his grief-stricken nephew,
who describes his uncle’s corpse as looking <span class="tei tei-q">“more
like that of a sleeping than of a dead man.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This then was the first, as it was also the most
violent, of the many outbreaks of Vesuvius which
our own age has witnessed, and with this eruption
of 79 in the reign of Titus, the Mountain, as we
have already said, greatly altered its shape. More
than half the rim of the ancient crater that had enclosed
Spartacus and his men less than two hundred
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page77">[pg 77]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>years before had been torn away and destroyed, its
remaining portion on the landward side retaining the
old name of Mons Summanus. Between this remnant
of the old wall of the crater and the scene of wreckage
on the southern face of the Mountain, there now
appeared the great cleft, the horse-shoe shaped valley
called the Atrio del Cavallo, which separates the two
peaks of the whole summit. A fragment only of
the original crater, known as the Pedimentina, still
remains on the seaward side above Torre del Greco.
From that terrible day, so vividly described by the
Younger Pliny, to our own times, a period stretching
over 1800 years, a vast number of eruptions, great
and small, have been enumerated, for owing to the
nearness of Vesuvius to one of the largest cities in
Europe, every incident connected with its activity
has been carefully noted, at least since the time of
the Renaissance. Out of the many upheavals we
propose to select the eruptions of 1631 and 1779,
as being amongst the most significant.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ever since an outburst in the year 1500, the
Mountain appears to have lapsed into a remarkable
condition of quietude, even of apparent extinction,
for over a century and a quarter, during which period,
it may be remarked, the Sicilian volcano of Etna
was unusually active. Once more the summit of
Vesuvius was beginning to assume the form it had
borne in the days previous to the overthrow of
Pompeii; the riven crater was becoming filled with
dense undergrowth and even with forest trees, amidst
which wild boar made their lairs and were occasionally
hunted. The learned Abate Giulio Braccini, whose
account of the eruption of 1631 is the most graphic
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg 78]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and accurate we possess, explored the crater shortly
before the outbreak of the volcano, but found little
to suggest any idea of an approaching convulsion.
He reckoned the deep depression occupying the crest
of the mountain to be about five miles in circumference,
and to take about a thousand paces of walking
so as to reach the lowest point within its area. He
remarked abundance of brushwood on its sides, and
observed cattle grazing peacefully upon the open
grassy patches in the midst of the over-grown space.
A deep crack, however, ran from end to end of the
whole crater, which allowed persons so minded to
descend amidst rocks and boulders to a large plain
below the surface, whereon Braccini found three pools
of hot steamy water, of a saline and sulphureous
taste. Such was the tranquil aspect of the Mountain
as surveyed by the Abate Braccini in the first half
of the seventeenth century; to men of science signs
of latent energy were certainly not wanting, yet to
the ignorant, careless peasants of the hill-side and the
scarcely less ignorant dwellers of the towns on the
seashore, the state of repose in which the Mountain
had continued for four or five generations suggested
no fears or suspicions. Tilling of vineyards, building
of new houses, sinking of wells, went on apace as
cheerfully as though an eruption were an impossibility,
till certain unmistakable portents that occurred
towards the close of the year 1631 roughly dissipated
this spell of fancied security. Earthquakes,
more or less severe, began at this time to be felt
along the whole of the volcanic line stretching from
Ischia to the eastern slopes of Vesuvius; the plain
within the crater of the Mountain began to heave
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg 79]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and rise in an alarming fashion, and the water in all
the local wells sank mysteriously below ground.
The signs of some impending disaster coming from
the heights above were too strongly marked to be
lightly disregarded; the idea of a volcanic convulsion,
though by this time a long-distant and vague memory,
became so terrifying to the dwellers on the mountain’s
flanks and in Torre del Greco, Resina and the various
towns that line the seaward base of the Mountain,
that the majority of the people removed themselves
and their property with all speed to places of safety.
Nevertheless, despite the warnings given by Nature
and also by men of science and the royal officials,
many remained behind in their houses, and in consequence
perished, to the immense number, it is surmised,
of 18,000. On the morning of Wednesday, December
16th, the long threatened eruption burst forth in
earnest upon an expectant world. Amidst crashes
like prolonged volleys of artillery the people of
Naples and the surrounding district beheld the terrible
pine-tree of smoke and ashes, described centuries ago
by Pliny, ascend from the south-western side of the
summit of the Mountain, veiling the sky for miles
around, and so charged with electricity, that many
were even killed by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ferilli</span></span>, or lightning flashes,
that darted from the smoking mass. The spectacle
of the ominous pine-tree was at once followed by a
terrific rumbling and an ejection of lava, which after
flowing down the southern flank in several streams
finally reached the sea, making the waters hiss and
boil at the moment of contact. Slowly but surely
these relentless red-hot rivers of lava crept like
serpents along the hill-side, destroying vineyard and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page80">[pg 80]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>garden, cottage and chapel, on their downward path.
Resina shared the fate of its ancient forerunner
Herculaneum, whilst Torre del Greco and Portici
suffered severely, as we can see to-day by noting
the great masses of lava flung on to the strand at
various points. To add to the universal confusion of
Nature, the sea, which had now become extraordinarily
tempestuous, probably owing to some submarine
earthquake-shock, suddenly retreated half a mile
from the coast, and then as suddenly returned in a
tidal wave more than a hundred feet beyond its
normal limits. Such were the main features of the
second great eruption of Vesuvius, wherein the ashes
ejected by the Mountain were wafted by the wind
beyond the Adriatic, to the Greek islands and even to
Constantinople itself.

From this date onward the Mountain became very
active in contrast with its previous condition of
lethargy, and throughout the whole of the eighteenth
century there were frequent eruptions, many of them
on a vast scale. All these outbursts have been carefully
recorded and commented upon, for naturally the
scientists of a great city like Naples were intensely
interested in the passing phases of their own volcano.
During the latter half of this century all the phenomena
have been described for us by Sir William
Hamilton, British ambassador at the Court of the
Two Sicilies, the versatile diplomatist who eventually
married the beautiful but frail Emma Hart. During
his long period of residence in Naples, Sir William
made no fewer than fifty-eight explorations of the
crater alone, besides carefully studying every peculiarity
visible upon the sides of the Mountain. He was,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page81">[pg 81]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of course, a close observer of the great eruptions of
1766-7, and also of the still greater convulsion of
1779, which, strangely enough, occurred on the
seventeenth centenary of the awakening of the
Mountain from its pre-historic slumbers. On this
occasion, Hamilton, accompanied by a Mr Bowdler
of Bath, had the temerity to track the streams of
flowing lava to their hidden source by walking over
the rough unyielding crust of stones and earth that
had formed upon the surface of the molten stream,
as it slowly trickled down hill at the rate of about a mile
an hour. The adventurous pair of Englishmen were
successful in their quest, and Sir William thus describes
the fountain-head of the fiery streams that he found
a quarter of a mile distant from the top of the cone.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The liquid and red-hot matter bubbled up
violently, with a hissing and crackling noise, like that
which attends the playing off of an artificial firework;
and by the continued splashing up of the vitrified
matter, a kind of arch, or dome, was formed over
the crevice from whence the lava issued; it was
cracked in many parts, and appeared red-hot within,
like a heated oven. This hollowed hillock might be
about fifteen feet high, and the lava that ran from
under it was received into a regular channel, raised
upon a sort of wall of scoriae and cinders, almost
perpendicularly, of about a height of eight or ten feet,
resembling much an ancient aqueduct.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some days later, at midnight on August 7th, a
veritable fountain of red fire shot up from the crest of
Vesuvius, illuminating all the surrounding country;
and on the following night a still more marvellous
sheet of flame appeared, hanging like a fiery veil
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page82">[pg 82]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>between heaven and earth, and reaching to a height
(so Sir William Hamilton guessed) of about 10,000
feet above the summit, affording a wonderfully grand
but terrible spectacle. This great curtain of fiery
particles, accompanied by inky black clouds from
which were darting continual flashes of lightning,
was reflected clearly on the smooth surface of the
Bay, delighting the Court and the scientific world of
Naples, but inspiring, as may well be imagined, the
mass of superstitious inhabitants with the direst alarm.
The theatres were closed and the churches were
opened; above the rumblings and explosions of the
agonised volcano could be heard the tolling of the
bells. Maddened by terror, the Neapolitan mob rushed
to the Archbishop’s palace to demand the immediate
production of the holy relics of St Januarius, the
protector of the city, and on this request being
refused, set fire to the entrance gates, a forcible
argument that soon persuaded his Eminence of the
propriety of the people’s demand. Thereupon the
head of the Saint, enclosed in its case of solid silver,
was accordingly borne in solemn procession with
wailing and repentant crowds behind it to an improvised
shrine, hung with garlands, on the Ponte
della Maddalena, at the extreme eastern boundary
of the city. Nor was the confidence reposed by the
Neapolitans in their patron Saint misplaced, for
except from the stifling smells and the dense rain
of ashes, the terror-stricken capital suffered not a whit,
whilst the general alarm inspired its inhabitants
with a revival of religious fervour which was by no
means insalutary. As usual, the old cynical proverb
was once more justified:—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Napoli fa gli peccati, e la
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page83">[pg 83]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">Torre gli paga</span></span>, for of course poor Torre del Greco
was grievously affected by the lava streams. In this
case, however, even Torre del Greco and Resina
did not fare so badly as did the towns on the
northern slopes of Monte Somma, a district which is
of course perfectly immune from lava inundations
owing to the protecting rocky ridge of the Atrio del
Cavallo. But it seems that the great veil of clouds
and fire, extending some thousands of feet from the
crest of the mountain to the heavens above, was
swayed by a chance current of air, so that its component
red-hot dust, ashes and stones were emptied
in one fatal shower upon the northern flank of the
Mountain. Whole villages were ruined, hundreds
of acres of vines and crops were scorched and burned;
the smiling peaceful hillside was in a few minutes
converted into a parched wilderness. Ottajano, a
large town of some 12,000 inhabitants, was the place
most seriously injured by this wholly unexpected
rain of destruction, for a tempestuous fall of red-hot
stones, some of immense size, and a shower of ashes
killed hundreds of the terrified and suffocating citizens,
and blocked up the streets with smoking debris to a
depth of four feet.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the recent eruptions of Vesuvius, which have
been pretty frequent during the latter half of last
century, that of April 1872, so carefully recorded
by Professor Palmieri, who in spite of imminent
danger never abandoned his post in the Observatory,
is the most notable. It is remembered also owing
to the catastrophe whereby some twenty persons out
of a large crowd of strangers, who had imprudently
ascended to the Atrio del Cavallo to get a closer
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page84">[pg 84]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>view of the phenomenon, were suddenly caught by the
lava stream and enfolded in its burning clutches.
For if ignorance and superstition seem to make the
poor fisherman or peasant unduly alarmed on such
occasions, curiosity and self-confidence are sometimes
apt to lead the educated or scientific into unnecessary
peril. Naples itself was once more alarmed in 1872,
so that the relics of St Januarius at the furious
demand of the populace were again brought forth in
solemn procession, and exposed towards the face
of the Mountain on the Ponte della Maddalena.
Thousands of quaking mortals gathered near this
spot, joining in the chanting of the priests and
watching with pallid anxious faces the fiery currents
of lava slowly trickling down the south-western flank
of Vesuvius towards the city itself. A certain number
of attendants meanwhile were engaged in perpetually
brushing away from the image of the Saint, from his
improvised altar, and from its votive garlands the
ever-accumulating mantle of grey dust, and it is
scarcely to be wondered at that a certain cool-headed
Neapolitan artist, Il Vaccaro, should all this time
have been busily engaged in painting so characteristic
and highly picturesque a scene. Within the churches,
and particularly in St Januarius’ own cathedral,
enormous crowds of hysterical men and women had
collected, loudly bewailing their past sins and imploring
the Divine mercy, for

Again the historic <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">palladium</span></span> proved effectual, and
the city, that was never for a moment in danger, was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg 85]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>once more saved! Naples received no damage
beyond a temporary panic and a heavy fall of ashes,
which covered every street and flat surface within the
town to a depth of some inches and which it took
many days of enforced labour to remove. Again
it was the poor confiding vine-dressers and tillers of
the Vesuvian soil who suffered in this upheaval, for
though the loss of life was very slight indeed, yet
numerous houses, fields and vineyards were totally
destroyed and many more were injured. Truly it is
a maxim well proven by time:—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Napoli fa gli peccati,
e Torre gli paga.</span></span>
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such, told baldly and briefly, is the history of the
Mountain, which forms the most conspicuous feature
of the Bay of Naples and dominates one of the
fairest and most populous districts on the face of the
globe. But it does not take long to make visitors
to the Neapolitan shore understand the mysterious
charm, not unmixed with awe, and the all-pervading
influence of Vesuvius. Go where we will within the
circuit of the Bay of Naples and even outside it, we
are never out of sight of the obtruding Mountain
and its smoky wreath. We begin to feel that the
Mountain is an animated thing, that the destiny of
the Parthenopean shore is locked up in the breast of
the Demon who has his dwelling within its red-hot
caverns. So sudden are the actions, and so capricious
the moods of this Monster of the Burning Mountain,
that no one can tell the day, or even the hour, wherein
he will give us an exhibition of his fiery temper,
though, it is true, in the case of violent eruptions he
is kind enough to afford timely warning by means
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page86">[pg 86]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of a succession of earthquakes and other signals
almost equally alarming. His Majesty’s presence is
felt everywhere; each morning as we open our
window upon the dazzling waters of the Bay, we
note with relief his tranquil aspect; each night, ere
we retire to sleep, we find ourselves inevitably drawn
to watch the glare thrown by the molten lava within
the crater upon the thick vapour overhead. The
nightly expectation of this aerial bonfire possesses
an extraordinary fascination for the stranger. Some
times the lurid glare is continuous; at other times
there are long intervals of waiting, and even then the
reflected light is very faint, a mere speck of reddish
glow in the surrounding blackness, gone in the
twinkling of an eye. But, strangely enough, one
grows to understand the Mountain better from a
distance and by watching its moods from afar, like
the Neapolitans themselves, who never ascend to
probe its mysteries, except a few vulgar guides and
touts who batten on the curiosity of the foreigner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On clear windless days the intermittent clouds of
vapour sent up from the crater assume the most
fantastic shapes—trees, ships, men, birds, animals—ever
changing like the forms of Proteus. It would
seem as if the Spirit of the Mountain were idly
amusing himself, like a child blowing bubbles, or a
vendor at a fair-stall carving out little figures of
gingerbread to tickle the fancy of country boys and
girls. The clouds so formed sometimes cause amusement
by their uncanny shapes, but not unfrequently
they inspire alarm. The superstitious peasant of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paduli</span></span>, looking up suddenly from his work amidst
the early peas or tomatoes, beholds against the blue
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page87">[pg 87]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sky a vague nebulous form that to his untutored mind
suggests a gigantic crucifix upheld in mid-air above
the Mountain, and he crosses himself devoutly ere he
bends down to earth once more to his work in the
rich dark soil. <span class="tei tei-q">“Such stuff as dreams are made of”</span>
appear in truth the weird phantoms that the sly
Demon of Vesuvius flings up into the pure aether,
and if credulous mankind likes to draw inferences
for good or bad from these unsubstantial creations
of his fancy, he laughs to himself with a hollow
reverberating sound. It must, however, have been
in the true spirit of prophecy on the occasion of
King Manfred’s birth, that the genius of the Mountain
despatched two cloud-forms into the sky (so the
unabashed old chroniclers gravely relate), one having
the appearance of a warrior armed cap-à-pie, and the
other that of a fully vested priest. The affrighted
gazers below, struck with the strange phenomenon,
beheld the two figures sway towards each other and
finally become locked together in deadly aerial combat,
until all resemblance to human shape had vanished
from the pair. Then, after an interval of time, men
perceived the cloudy mass once more assume a mortal
shape, and a huge towering priest with flowing robes
and tiara on head was left in solitary and victorious
possession of the sky. The Churchman had swallowed
up the soldier; the Pontiff had vanquished the King;
it was a true premonition of the fatal field of
Benevento, which saw the ultimate triumph of the
Papal over the Imperial cause.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But if the near presence of the burning mountain
has tended to make the inhabitants of its immediate
zone the slaves of superstitious awe, the disasters of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page88">[pg 88]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>generations have likewise imbued them with a spirit of
fatalism, that appears even stronger than their outward
show of credulity. Life is not so sweet nor so dear
apparently to these children of the South, but that
they can afford to take their chance of disturbance or
death with a true philosophic calm. The fisher-folk
and maccaroni workers of Resina, Portici and the two
Torres have, it is true, little to lose; a small boat can
at the last moment easily convey their families and
slender stock of household furniture to a place of
temporary safety, and when the danger is over-past,
the same shallop can bring back the refugees and their
belongings. But with the husbandmen the case is
different. Not only has he to fear the actual stream
of lava, which may or may not overwhelm his house
and farm in its slow inevitable course, but there are
also the showers of hot ashes and of scalding water
that will frizzle up in a few seconds every green blade
and leaf upon his tiny domain, for which he pays an
enormous rental, sometimes as much as £12 sterling
an acre. Yet the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">contadino</span></span> takes his chances with a
seraphic resignation that we do not usually attribute
to the southern temperament. After the eruption of
1872, which covered the rich <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paduli</span></span> with a deep
coating of grey ashes, a young peasant girl was heard
deploring the loss of her carefully tended gourds and
melons; <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Oh come volimme fa? Addio, pummarole!
addio, cucuzzielle!</span></span>”</span> whereupon an older woman, witnessing
these useless tears, upbraided her with the
words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not complain, child, lest worse befall you!”</span>
And indeed the whole population of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paduli</span></span>, instead
of lamenting over their scorched and spoiled crops,
were jubilant at the thought that the havoc done was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page89">[pg 89]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>only partial, not irrevocable;—a few months of incessant
labour, said they, would bring back the holdings
to their former state of perfection. Yet a general
opinion prevails among foreigners that the Neapolitans
are lazy, thriftless and helpless! They indeed rely
to a certain extent upon St Januarius to protect their
crops from the efforts of Nature, over which, they
argue, the Saint is more likely to possess control than
his human applicants, but when once the fatal shower
of ashes has fallen, they do not expect <span class="tei tei-q">“San Gennaro”</span>
to set their injured acres to rights again, but with a
rare patience turn to the task themselves. A more
industrious, and at the same time a more capable and
practical race of agriculturists than the tillers of the
slopes of Vesuvius, it would be hard to match. And
thus in the sunshine of the south, yet ever under the
shadow of death and destruction, dwell many thousands
of human beings, as unconcerned as though Vesuvius
were miles and miles away. Not unconscious, but
fully conscious of their doom, the victims of the
Mountain toil and moil upon the fertile farms (in
many cases risen phoenix-like from their own ashes)
that grow the early beans and tomatoes, the egg-plants
and the white fennel roots (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">finocchi</span></span>) that well-fed
travellers devour in the hotels of Naples. Or else
they tend the vines that yield the generous <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lagrima
Christi</span></span>, of which imprudent and heated visitors drink
long draughts unmixed with water, and then complain
of ensuing languor and pains beneath their waistcoats.
Luscious, yet seductive wine! Counsellor of moderation
after a first experience of excess! Essence of
Vesuvius, whose strange name so puzzled the poet
Chiabrera!

Scarcely had the above pages been written, than
the Mountain, which had been drowsing for more than
thirty years, suddenly awakened to give appalling evidence
of its latent activity and powers of mischief.
The eruption of April 1906 has, in fact, surpassed all
previous outbursts within living memory, and it may
probably be reckoned amongst the most violent of all
hitherto recorded. Many of the details of this event
doubtless remain fresh in the memory, and in any case
the sad condition of numerous towns and villages, and
of the beautiful Vesuvian districts, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">paesi ridenti</span></span> as
the Neapolitans affectionately term these fertile lands,
will serve for some years to come as a sinister and
ever-present reminder of the horrors of the past and
of the dread possibilities of the future. All vegetation
for miles around the volcano has been injured or
destroyed, for not only was the Mountain itself
covered deep with grit and ashes, but the streets and
gardens of Naples, the luxuriant plain of Sorrento, and
even the heights of Capri, twenty miles distant across
the Bay, were shrouded in a funereal mantle of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page91">[pg 91]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>greyish-yellow dust that Vesuvius had flung into the
air to let fall like a shower of parching and destructive
rain upon the earth. How vast was the amount of
matter ejected from the crater and scattered in this
form over the surrounding country, we may judge from
the scientific calculation that 315,000 tons fell in
Naples alone! Everywhere appeared the same scenes
of desolation, the same dreary tint, for so thickly had
this aerial torrent of ashes descended, that buildings,
trees and plants were completely hidden by
it, the whole landscape suggesting the idea of a
recent heavy fall of dirty-coloured snow. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paesi
ridenti</span></span>, indeed! It was a land of ugliness and
mourning, a city of stifling air and of human
terror.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A few days previous to the eruption, which began
on April 5th, the island of Ustica, which lies some
forty miles north of Palermo, had been visited by
earthquake shocks of such violence that the Italian
Government at last decided to remove the greater
part of its population to the mainland, as well as the
convicts attached to the penal settlements on the
island. Scarcely had these manifestations ceased at
Ustica, than Vesuvius began to show signs of
increased activity; the supplies in the wells on the
mountain sides began to fail, and there was observed
a strong taste of sulphur in the drinking water;
whilst—most dreaded phenomenon of all—the ever-active
crater of Stromboli, that lies midway between
Naples and Messina, suddenly lapsed into quiescence.
We all know the subsequent story of the outbreak;
of the thousands of fugitives flying into Naples or
other places of refuge; of the utter destruction of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page92">[pg 92]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>houses and cultivated lands;—the doleful scenes of a
Vesuvian eruption have been enacted and described
time after time in the history of the Mountain, and
there is every reason to suppose they will be repeated
at intervals for centuries to come. The marvel is
how human beings can calmly settle down and pass
their lives so close to the jaws of the fire-spouting
monster, and why an intelligent Government permits
its subjects to dwell in places which are ever exposed
to catastrophes such as that which we have just
witnessed. Well, it is the natural temperament of
the Vesuviani to be fatalistic, despite their religious
fervour; and acts of legislature cannot force them to
abandon their old deep-rooted notions; all that the
Italian Government can do therefore is to stand ready
prepared to help, when the upheaval <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">does</span></span> occur, as it
inevitably must.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is always a matter of speculation on these
occasions as to what course the ejected lava will
pursue; whose turn, of the many settlements on the
southern slopes of the Mountain, will it be to suffer?
This time it was Bosco-Trecase, a village above Torre
Annunziata, that was devastated by the sinuous
masses of incandescent matter, high as a house and
broad as a river. Torre Annunziata itself, as also
ruined Pompeii were threatened, but the red-hot
streams of destruction mercifully stopped short of
their expected prey. The story of horrors and panic
in the overthrow of Bosco-Trecase is happily relieved
by many a recorded incident of valour and unselfishness.
The royal <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Carabinieri</span></span>, that splendid body of
mounted police, who in their cocked hats and voluminous
cloaks appear as ornamental in times of quiet as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page93">[pg 93]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>they prove themselves useful in the stormy hours of
peril, acquitted themselves, as usual, like heroes. It
was they who guided away the trembling peasants
before the advance of the lava, searching the doomed
houses for sick and crippled, whom they carried on
their shoulders to places of security. Working, too,
with almost equal zeal and practical good sense were
the Italian soldiers, who richly deserved the praise
that their royal commander, the Duke of Aosta,
subsequently bestowed upon them for their invaluable
services rendered during these fearful days of darkness
and danger. <span class="tei tei-q">“Soldiers!”</span> declared the Duke, in his
address to the troops on April 23rd, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have seen
you calm and happy in the work of alleviating the
misfortunes of others, and I put on record the praise
you have won. By promptly appearing at the places
distressed by the eruption, you have encouraged the
people by your presence and your example; you
have maintained order and have safe-guarded property.
Helping the local authorities, and even in some
instances filling their offices, you have carried out the
most urgent and dangerous duties in order to save
the houses and to keep clear the roads. In the
spots most heavily afflicted you have lent your
assistance in removing and caring for the injured,
and in searching for and burying the dead you have
given proofs of great self-sacrifice and reverence
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pietà</span></span>). Not a few of the refugees have obtained
food and shelter in your barracks, and whole communities
without means of existence have been
provided by you with the necessaries of life. Everywhere
and from all your conduct has gained you
loud applause. Nevertheless, your task is not yet
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page94">[pg 94]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ended; continue at it out of love for your country
and devotion to your King!”</span><a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With such a reputation for kindness of heart and
energy in time of need, no wonder that the Army is
popular with all classes in Italy!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor did the King and Queen hold aloof from the
scene of disaster, for they hurried from Rome at
midnight of that terrible Palm Sunday on purpose
to comfort the terror-stricken population. Victor-Emmanuel
even penetrated in his motor-car as far as
Torre Annunziata, in spite of the fumes of sulphur
and the many difficulties in proceeding along roads
clogged deep with volcanic dust and ashes. On
another occasion the King and Queen paid a visit to
the afflicted district of the slopes of Monte Somma,
where Ottajano and San Giuseppe had been almost
buried by the continuous falling of burning material
from the crater. In fact, these localities suffered
even more severely than the towns on the seaward
face of the Mountain (Bosco-Trecase excepted), and
at Ottajano hardly a house in the place remained
intact at the close of the eruption, whilst the loss of
human life was probably higher here than elsewhere.
The Duke and Duchess of Aosta—he the king’s
cousin, and she the popular Princess Hélène, daughter
of the late Comte de Paris—were likewise indefatigable
in their efforts to assist and reassure the
demoralized population, and to make every possible
arrangement for the feeding and housing of the
numberless refugees and the tending of the injured in
the hospitals of Naples. Equally valorous was the
conduct of the great scientist, Professor Matteucci,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page95">[pg 95]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>who remained together with a few Carabinieri throughout
all phases of the eruption at the Vesuvian
Observatory, although in imminent peril of death
amidst a deadly atmosphere of heat and sulphureous
fumes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was on April 5th that the streams of burning
lava first burst from the riven crater and made their
way down the south-eastern slopes, destroying Bosco-Trecase
and reaching to the very suburbs of Torre
Annunziata. Pompeii itself was imperilled, and it is
always well to remember that during an eruption this
precious relic of antiquity may possibly be lost to the
world. Meanwhile the rain of ashes and mud—formed
by dust and hot water commingling—fell incessantly;
150,000 inhabitants of the Vesuvian districts fled in
precipitate flight towards Naples, towards the shore,
towards the hill country beyond the Sarno. It was
truly a marvellous spectacle to observe the relentless
stream of burning lava crushing irresistibly every
opposing object in its fatal path. Onlookers at a
distance could perceive the walls of houses bulging
outward under pressure of the moving mass, until the
roof collapsed in an avalanche of tiles upon the ground,
whilst with a final crash the whole structure—cottage,
farm, church or stately villa—succumbed to the
overwhelming weight.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many are the tales of courage and intrepidity; not
a few, alas! are the stories of folly and cowardice that
are related in connection with the eruption. It cannot
be said that the population of Naples, where everybody
was perfectly safe even if the atmosphere was
unpleasant and the distant thunders of the Mountain
reverberated alarmingly, comported itself with dignity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page96">[pg 96]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>or calm; and this criticism applies in particular to
the hundreds of visitors—English, German, American
and other <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">forestieri</span></span>—who besieged the railway station
in frantic and indecent anxiety to remove themselves
with all speed from the city. Some excuse might
perhaps be found for the hysterical terror of the poor
inhabitants of the Mergellina or the Mercato, who
spent their time in wailing within the churches or in
screaming for the public exhibition of the venerated
relics of their patron Saint, which again on this occasion
the Archbishop, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nolens volens</span></span>, was compelled by
the mob to produce. But for the great mass of
educated foreigners then filling the hotels and pensions
of the place, it cannot be said that their conduct was
edifying, particularly in face of the example set by the
King and Queen of Italy. To add to the general
panic prevailing in the city, the Neapolitans themselves
were not unnaturally greatly exasperated by the
serious accident which took place at the Central
Market Hall near Monte Oliveto in the heart of the
old town. Here, early one morning during the course
of the eruption, the great roof of corrugated iron
collapsed, killing many and frightening the whole of
the populace, already sufficiently unnerved by recent
events. That this catastrophe was due to the casual
methods, amounting in this case to criminal neglect of
plain duty, of the municipal authorities, who had
neglected to sweep the accumulation of heavy volcanic
ash from off the thin metal roof, none can deny; and
this glaring example of public stupidity had of course
a bad effect on the demoralized multitude, which
threatened to grow unruly, as well as terrified. No,
the graceless stampede of educated foreigners to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page97">[pg 97]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>railway-station, the incompetence of the Municipality,
and the behaviour of the Neapolitan crowd do not
appear very creditable to the supposed enlightenment
of the twentieth century. It had been confidently
predicted that nearly fifty years of State education
and liberal government would work wonders in dispelling
the crass ignorance and the deep-seated
superstition of the dwellers on the Bay of Naples.
Yet, so far as can be judged from recent events,
matters seem to have changed but little on these
shores, for the mass of the population evidently preferred
to pin its hope of safety to the miracle-working
relics of San Gennaro, rather than to the reassuring
messages of Professor Matteucci, sent from his post
of undoubted peril on the mountain-side.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If the inhabitants of a great city, which was never
seriously threatened with danger, should have acted
thus, there is undoubtedly much excuse to be found
for the Vesuviani themselves, whose houses and lives
were certainly in danger from the devastating streams
of lava. It was with a sigh and a smile that we
learned how the good people of Portici attributed
their escape from the fate of Bosco-Trecase to the
direct interposition of a wonder-working Madonna enshrined
in one of their own churches. For some days
the town had been threatened, so that many were
convinced of its impending doom, when happily at
the last moment the expected fate was averted, as
though by a miracle. And miracle it truly was in
the eyes of the people of Portici, when it was observed
that the snow-white hands of their popular
Madonna had turned black in some mysterious manner
during the night hours. What could be a simpler
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page98">[pg 98]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>or easier deduction from this circumstance, than that
Our Lady’s Effigy, taking pity on its affrighted
suppliants, had with its own hands pushed back the
advancing mass of lava, and thus saved the town!
Great was the joy, and equally great the gratitude,
displayed by these poor souls at Portici, who at once
organised a triumphal procession in honour of their
prescient patroness <span class="tei tei-q">“delle mani nere.”</span> Does not such
an incident, we ask, lend a touch of picturesque
medievalism to a modern scene of horror and darkness,
exhibiting to us, as it does, the traits of a simple
touching faith and of genuine human thankfulness?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Well, the great eruption of 1906 is over, and the
inhabitants of the Vesuvian communes are once more
settling down in their ruined homes, or their damaged
farms and gardens. No doubt a new Bosco-Trecase
will arise on the shapeless ruins of the old site, for fear
of danger seems powerless to deter the outcast population
from reoccupying its old haunts. Ottajano will
be rebuilt, not for the first time, and its citizens will
again trust to luck—and to St Januarius—for protection
from the evil fate which has repeatedly
overtaken their town. The two Torres, Resina,
Portici, and the villages along the shore, have this
time contrived to escape the lava streams, and
though their buildings have been severely shaken, and
even wrecked in many instances, the people will
doubtless mend the cracks in their walls and place
fresh tiles on the injured roofs. They are wise in
their own generation, for the Mountain is not likely to
burst forth again for another quarter of a century at
least after so violent a fit, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">salvo complicazioni</span></span>, of course,
as the more cautious Italians themselves say. But
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page99">[pg 99]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>another outburst is inevitable; and whose turn to
suffer will it be then? Will it be Portici, or either of
the Torres? Who knows?—and what dweller under
Vesuvius to-day cares at this moment? <span class="tei tei-q">“Under
Vesuvius,”</span> but it is a new Vesuvius, for the tall cone
which was so conspicuous a feature of the Bay of
Naples has disappeared completely, and the summit
of the volcano has been once more reduced to the
level of Monte Somma. How many years, we
wonder, will be required for the Mountain to raise for
itself once more the tall pyre of ashes that it has
itself demolished and flung on all sides to the winds?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is without any feelings of regret that we learn
of the non-existence of a railway line beyond
Castellamare, so that our journey to Amalfi along the
coast must be performed in the good old-fashioned
manner of long-past <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vetturino</span></span> days. Three skinny
horses harnessed abreast are standing ready at the
hotel door to draw our travelling chariot, each member
of the team gorgeously decked with plumes of
pheasant feathers in his head-gear and with many-coloured
trappings, whilst on the harness itself appears
in more than one place the little brazen hand, which is
supposed to ensure the steed’s safety from the dangers
of any chance <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jettatore</span></span>, the unlucky wight endowed
with the Evil Eye. Nor is the swarthy picturesque
ruffian who acts as our driver unprovided with a
talisman in case of emergency, for we observe hanging
from his heavy silver watch-chain the long twisted
horn of pink coral, which is popularly supposed to
catch the first baleful glance, and to act on the
principle of a lightning-conductor, in deflecting the
approaching danger from the prudent wearer of the
coral trinket. Merrily to the sound of jingling bells
and the deep-chested exhortations of our coachman do
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>we bowl along the excellent road in the freshness of
the morning air and light <span class="tei tei-q">“through varying scenes of
beauty ever led,”</span> for the Corniche road towards Amalfi
is admitted to be one of the finest in the world.
Following the serpentine curves above the cliffs, we
have on our right hand the dazzling Mediterranean
with classic capes and islands all flushed in the early
sunshine, whilst above us on the left rise the steep
fertile slopes of the Lactarian Hills. Convent and
villa, cottage and farmhouse, peep out of embowering
verdure, whilst our road is shaded in many
places by the overhanging boughs of blossoming
almond and loquat trees. The whole region is in
truth a veritable garden of the Hesperides, where in
the mild equable climate fruit and flowers ripen and
bloom without a break throughout the rolling year.

A lovely and a fertile scene it is indeed, and

Italy, wherein the rich well-tilled lands appear in
striking contrast with the near-lying stony fallows and
scrub-covered wastes.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beneath the picturesque pile of Santa Maria a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Pozzano, perched aloft above the roadway, we pass
along the edge of the sea-girt precipice, rounding the
Capo d’Orlando, until we reach the pretty little town
of Vico Equense, with its churches and gay-coloured
villas nestling amidst groves of olive and orange trees.
Vico owes its prosperity in the first instance to the
patronage of <span class="tei tei-q">“Carlo il Zoppo,”</span> Charles the Dwarf,
the lame son and heir of King Charles of Anjou, who
founded a settlement and built a villa upon the site of
the ancient Roman colony; and it was in the old
royal demesne of the Angevins that the hand of
the deformed king’s daughter, the Princess Clementia,
was demanded formally in marriage by the French
monarch, Philip the Bold, who sought to marry her to
his third son, Charles of Valois. The match between
the young prince of France and his cousin, the
Neapolitan princess, appeared suitable to all concerned
in every respect save one; for it was well known that
the King of Naples had been lame from his birth, and
it could never be deemed fit for the expected heir of
France to marry any but a perfectly sound and
healthy bride. Now the Queen of Naples was too
proud to accede to the hints of the French ladies, who
evidently were most anxious to acquaint themselves
with the satisfactory condition of her daughter’s
<span class="tei tei-q">“walking members,”</span> though she went so far as to
allow the maiden to appear before them clad only in
a flowing robe of gossamer silk. The possible danger
of losing her opportunity to become Queen of France
proved, however, beyond the ambitious young lady’s
powers of endurance, and to the horror of her haughty
mother and the delight of the foreign emissaries, the
Princess Clementia then and there doffed her silken
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>robes and appeared before all in the historic garb of
Lady Godiva. A glance at the princess’s form <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in
puris naturalibus</span></span> sufficed to convince the inquisitive
Frenchwomen that no hereditary taint from Il Zoppo
descended to his daughter; and accordingly the
betrothal of the two young people was celebrated that
very evening amidst the usual revels and feastings.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The clean cheerful town on the sheer limestone
crags boasts a cathedral, wherein, so the guide-book
informs us, we shall find the tomb of Filangieri, the
great Italian jurist. But the building contains in
reality far more stirring associations than those connected
with a prominent lawyer. It is but a rococo
structure of the usual Italian type, and its painted
series of portraits of past bishops is by no means an
uncommon complement of cathedral churches in the
South. But here, amidst the long rows of indifferent
portraits, we note an omission, a space that is occupied,
not by a likeness but by a medallion, which
represents a cherub with the forefinger of his right
hand laid as a seal of silence upon the lips. Here-by
indeed hangs a tale, obscure perhaps, but pathetic
and human to the last degree. We all remember the
broad frieze filled with Doges’ faces which is carried
round the great hall of the ducal palace in Venice,
wherein the place assigned to the traitor, Marino
Faliero, contains a black veil instead of the usual
portrait. Here in little Vico Equense is to be found
a somewhat similar incident, but with this important
difference:—the bishop whose portrait is here omitted
was the most worthy of remembrance of all his peers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The crime of Monsignore Michele Natale, Bishop
of Vico Equense, to which the silent cherub bears
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>everlasting witness, was that of being a patriot and
a Liberal (in the truest sense of that term) during
the anxious times of the ill-fated Parthenopean
Republic, that short-lived period of aristocratic government
which was set up in self-defence by certain
Neapolitan nobles, prelates and men of science after
the abrupt departure of their cowardly King and
Queen to Palermo. We all remember the terrible
ending of that government: how the vile rabble-army
of Cardinal Ruffo assaulted Naples; how the
city capitulated to the Cardinal on the express condition
that all life and property should be spared;
and how Lord Nelson, refusing to recognise the terms
that Ruffo himself had agreed to, and overruling the
Cardinal’s protests, treated the unhappy prisoners.
The Bishop of Vico Equense was one of this band
of martyrs, for he suffered death under circumstances
of exceptional brutality on the morning of August
20th 1799, in the piazza in front of the church of
the Carmine, together with two Neapolitans of noble
rank, Giuliano Colonna and Gennaro Serra, and with
the poetess, Eleonora Pimentel, a Portuguese by
birth but the widow of a Neapolitan officer. All
went nobly to their doom amidst the execrations of
the demoralised bloodthirsty mob of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lazzaroni</span></span>, yelling
at and insulting the <span class="tei tei-q">“Jacobins,”</span> and kept back with
no little difficulty by the royal troops from mutilating
the corpses of women, bishops and princes.
Monsignore Natale himself was hanged, and in his
case the public executioner—<span class="tei tei-q">“Masto Donato”</span> as he
was nick-named by the populace—gave vent to
many pleasantries concerning the episcopal rank of
his victim. Blindfolded and with the cord of infamy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>depending from his neck, the Bishop was led up to the
fatal ladder amid deafening shouts of

On reaching the top of the gallows, the hangman
made fast the rope to the cross-tree, and then an
assistant (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tirapiede</span></span>) from below adroitly pushed the
unseeing prisoner into space, catching on to his legs
meanwhile, whilst <span class="tei tei-q">“Masto Donato”</span> himself adroitly
leaped from the gallows-top upon the prelate’s
shoulder. With the hangman on his back, shouting
aloud how much he was enjoying his ride upon a
real bishop, and with the other ruffian clinging to his
heels, Monsignore Natale swayed backwards and forwards
amidst yells of execration and gratified hate
on that hot August morning in front of the Church
of the Carmine little more than one hundred years
ago. His body was left on the gallows to be insulted
by the mob throughout the long sweltering day, and
then, stripped of all its clothing, was finally flung
with other corpses of noble men and women into a
charnel-house at Sant’ Alessio al Lavinaio. Who it
was that placed this quaint little memorial to the
murdered prelate in his cathedral church we know
not; but here the speechless yet eloquent cherub
tells Natale’s sad story of brutality and injustice to
all who care to listen. Happily the spell of silence
is at length broken, and the true history of that
hateful era of crime, cruelty, lying, and intrigue is
gradually being revealed; and the enemies of the
Church in Italy learn with an astonishment, which
is perhaps feigned, that in that glorious army of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>martyrs of 1799 more than one ecclesiastic of high
rank suffered in the ill-starred and premature cause of
Neapolitan liberty.

Crossing the little river Arco, we proceed uphill
through the region of vines and olives, until we have
passed the Punta di Scutolo, where begins our
descent into that famous tract of country, the Piano
di Sorrento, a plateau above the cliffs, some four miles
in length by one in breadth. Poets of antiquity and
bards of the Middle Ages alike have sung the
delights of the Sorrentine Plain, and have painted
in glowing colours of inspired verse its race of happy
peasants, its fruitful fields and orchards, its luscious
vines, its excellent flocks. Galen, the cunning old
physician, recommended to his nervous patients what
would now be termed a <span class="tei tei-q">“rest cure”</span> in these favoured
regions; whilst the grateful Bernardo Tasso, father of
the immortal Torquato, speaks of the capital of this
district as <span class="tei tei-q">“l’Albergo della Cortesia,”</span> and in an
ecstasy of delighted appreciation, goes on to add:
<span class="tei tei-q">“l’aere e si sereno, si temperato, si salutifero, si vitale,
che gli uomini che senza provar altero cielo ci vivono
sono quasi immortali.”</span> And though praise from
Torquato’s courtly sire must not be taken too
seriously, yet few will deny that the beautiful plain
deserves many of the eulogies that have been
showered upon it. At the small town of Meta, the
next place of importance after Sorrento itself, the road
divides at the Church of the Madonna of the Laurel:
our way to Amalfi leading southward over the opposing
ridge—the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sorrentini Colles”</span> of Ovid—whilst
the other traverses the length of the plain by way of
Pozzopiano and Sant’ Agnello, until it reaches Sorrento.

One prominent feature of this district has already
attracted our attention; the number of deep ravines
with which the whole plain is intersected. These
natural clefts are marvellously lovely in their rich
luxuriance of foliage, and with their precipitous sides
and verdure-clad depths will recall the wonderful
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">latomiè</span></span>, the ancient stone-quarries of Syracuse. Their
depths are filled with orange and lemon trees, mingled
with sable spires of cypress and the tall forms of bays,
which here bear jet-black berries, such as are rarely seen
in our northern clime; whilst the edges of the cliffs
are clothed with a serried mass of wild flowers; red
valerian, crimson snap-dragon, tall blue campanulas,
the dark green wild fennel, white-blossoming cistus,
and a hundred other plants, gay with colour and
strong with aromatic perfume.

It is not surprising to learn that these romantic glens,
filled with greenery, are reputed locally to be the haunts
of fairies, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Monacelli</span></span>, as the Sorrentine inhabitants
name them. Like the <span class="tei tei-q">“good folk”</span> of certain country
districts in England, the pixies of Devonshire, and the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Tylwyth Teg”</span> of rural Wales, these elfin people of
the ravines are not malicious or unkindly in their nature,
but they are particular and somewhat exacting in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>certain matters. They appreciate the attentions of
mortal men, and offerings of fresh milk or choice
fruit are not beneath the notice of the Monacelli.
Borrowing the idea from the votive offerings they
make in the churches to the Virgin and the Saints,
the peasants sometimes place little lamps in the fern-draped
grottoes of these gullies, and to such as
punctually perform these acts of courtesy, the
Monacelli frequently show signs of favour. The
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">padrone</span></span> of a local inn has assured us that he and
his wife stood very high in the good graces of the
little people, who had on one occasion actually
written them a letter, although as the characters
employed were unknown to any person in the
village, the object of their communication by this
means seems somewhat of a mystery. Another and
a more practical instance of their patronage was
then related, for the favoured landlord assured us
that on one occasion, when he and his wife descended
downstairs in the morning, they found the house
cleared, the hearth ready swept, and all the contents
of last night’s supper-table relaid on the brick floor,
but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d’un modo squisito</span></span>, such as no human hand could
ever have been deft enough to contrive. Just a simple
innocent trifle of Sorrentine folk-lore, but how closely
does it resemble the old-time gossip of rustic England,
of which the great poet has left us so charming
a picture!—

For, as we have already said, the Monacelli show
themselves grateful to those who anticipate their
wants, and will serve their votaries with industry
and fidelity. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fuore avra il Monacello in casa</span></span>—perhaps
he has had the Fairy in the house—has
passed into a local phrase to designate a neighbour’s
unexplained prosperity. But, again, the lucky recipient
of these favours must never blab or even hint
at the origin of his good fortune, for all gossip is
highly distasteful to the fairy folk; and that, we
suppose, is the true reason why so little authentic
information can be gleaned as to the methods of
the Monacelli.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In direct contrast with the Monacelli of the ravines,
who are, on the whole, well inclined towards mortals,
are the Maghe, first cousins evidently to the terrible
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ginns</span></span> of Arabian folk-lore; perhaps the Saracenic
pirates themselves may have introduced their oriental
sprites to the Neapolitan shores. In the popular mind
the Maghe are supposed to possess vast treasures
hidden in caves by the seashore, or on the bleak
mountain side, and it was doubtless concerning these
spirits that the guide’s tale, given in a previous chapter,
relates. The most celebrated Maga of all is the demon
who haunts a certain underground corridor near
Pozzuoli, containing an immense hoard of gold and
jewels, which he is willing to present to anybody
that is ready to give in exchange a new-born baby,
presumably for purposes of devouring. Nor was the
general belief in the cave-dwelling monster at Pozzuoli
limited to the poor peasants and fisher-folk, for rumour
persistently asserted that King Francis of Naples,
father of Bomba of impious memory, more than once
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>attempted to negotiate with the guardian of this
buried treasure; but the Maga’s terms, it seems,
were too bloodthirsty and extravagant even for a
Neapolitan Bourbon to comply with, and in that
case they must indeed have been pretty startling.
Malignant fairies are, in short, quite common upon
the Sorrentine plain, where exasperated mothers are
sometimes in the habit of frightening their squalling
children into silence by threatening to introduce them
to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mammone</span></span>—perhaps a corruption of the old Greek
word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mormo</span></span>—a terrible ghost, that must be a near
relation to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Big Black Man”</span> of English nurseries,
who is ever ready to carry off naughty boys and girls
in his sack.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the whole of the Sorrentine Peninsula is full of
local superstitions, the vast majority of which can easily
be traced to the influence of Catholicism, whilst comparatively
few seem to be the legacy of ancient Greek
or Roman mythology. Belief in witchcraft is universal
in these parts, but the witch herself (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">strega</span></span>) is regarded
somewhat in the light of a beneficent <span class="tei tei-q">“wise woman,”</span>
who can arrest the far more dreaded spell of the Evil
Eye, rather than as the malevolent old hag of bucolic
England in the past. Certainly there has never been
recorded in Southern Italy any such popular persecution
of poor harmless old crones as once disgraced
English countrysides; nor has any Italian jurist, like
the erudite Sir Matthew Hale, ever condescended to
supply legal information concerning the peculiarities
of witches, and the best methods of prosecuting and
burning them. But the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">strega</span></span>, though not as a rule
dangerous to mankind, provided she be not disturbed
or insulted, has the same supernatural power of transit
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>on a broomstick that is possessed by her northern
sister. On many a dark night have the peasants
crossed themselves with fear on hearing the witches
flying through the storm-vexed air to keep their unholy
tryst beside the famous walnut tree of Benevento, which
has been described for us by the learned Pietro Piperno
in his mysterious treatise, entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Nuce Beneventana</span></span>.
Even snatches of the witches’ song can sometimes be
distinguished above the howling of the gale—

Perhaps it may afford some consolation to those
who have a dread of witches that the word <span class="tei tei-q">“Sabato,”</span>
solemnly pronounced on these awful occasions, is of
real service to the utterer; whilst such as have had

But at length we have finished the ascent of
the ridge, and our driver halts for a moment at
the inn of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Due Golfi.”</span> A smiling damsel,
dressed in the picturesque native costume, advances to
offer us the national drink of Italy, sweet vermouth
that is frothed up with a little fizzing water in a narrow
tumbler; and though carriage exercise is not liable to
produce thirst, yet we cannot be so churlish as to
refuse the draught, especially as the delay allows us to
take our farewell look at the Bay of Naples. For here
we have reached the peak of the rocky saddle that
divides the two famous gulfs; and before us we now
behold the wide crescent of the Bay of Salerno with
its sunburnt vineyards and its precipitous cliffs. To
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>our right we perceive the craggy headlands stretching
southward till they culminate in the Cape of Minerva:—how
much more attractive sounds the good old classical
name than the new-fangled Punta della Campanella,
so called from the alarm bell which used to be tolled
in the ruined fortress at the approach of the Moslem
pirate galleys! Vastly different is the aspect on this
side of the peninsula to that which we have just left
behind us. There is the plain below us, thickly dotted
with farms and villas set amidst crops and orchards, a
fertile scene of industry and population; here on the
Salerno side are wild stony tracts affording only pasturage
for a few sheep and goats, and covered for
miles with broom, cytizus, coronella, myrtle, and numberless
fragrant weeds, all struggling fiercely for existence
on the dry barren soil, and filling the clear air
with an incense-like perfume. Such is our first acquaintance
with the Costiera d’Amalfi, that wonderful
stretch of indented rocky coast-line once containing
the Republic of Amalfi, which was the forerunner of
the glorious Commonwealths of Florence and Venice.
From the grey cliffs of Capri to the west, as far as the
headland beside Salerno, stretched this diminutive
state, composed of a confederacy of sister-cities, whereof
Amalfi herself was the queen and metropolis. Its
glories have long vanished, but the Costiera d’Amalfi
remains an enchanted land, not only on account of its
natural beauties, but also by reason of its historical
associations which give an additional charm to every
breezy headland and every little town upon this
wonderful shore.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Below us, as we rapidly descend the slopes by the
curves of the Corniche road, lies the little beach known
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as Lo Scaricotojo, whence in the days previous to the
construction of this splendid highway all visitors were
wont to embark for Amalfi;—that is, unless they
attempted the expedition by way of the mountain
roads leading thither from Castellamare or La Cava.
It raises a smile in these days of swift and luxurious
travelling to learn from an early Victorian guide-book
that <span class="tei tei-q">“the most elegible mode of going from Sorrento
to Amalfi is either to ride or to be carried in a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">chaise
à porteurs</span></span> to that part of the Colli where begins a
rapid descent, and thence descending on foot to the
Marinella of the Scaricotojo on the Gulf of Salerno....
The ride occupies about an hour and a quarter,
and the descent which, though steep, is not dangerous,
occupies about an hour.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nous avons changé tout ça</span></span>;
yet there are still living amongst us those who lament
the passing away of the old-fashioned days of Italian
travel, when inns were bad but picturesque, and expeditions
to such remote places as Amalfi were not only difficult
but even dangerous; since in compensation
for slow progress and risk of brigands every town
owned a primitive charm which is now rapidly disappearing
before the modern irruption of locust-like
swarms of tourists with their motor cars, their luncheon
baskets, and their kodaks. Well, to the majority of
travellers the value of natural scenery is not a little
enhanced by the sense of comfort, and here on the
Costiera d’Amalfi the most particular can have no
cause to complain, since it is one of the few lovely
spots of Southern Europe that has not yet been invaded
by the dividend-paying railway. No, the old
Republic retains to a great extent its ancient atmosphere
of unspoiled beauty and remoteness from the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>bustling world. It is still a stretch of glorious and
historic country wherein one can obtain a pleasant and
valued respite for a time from the overpowering improvements
of an industrial age.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As we look southward across the breadth of the
Bay, our eye is at once caught by the group of the
Isles of the Sirens, which, though in reality fully a
mile distant from the nearest point of the coast, seem
in this clear atmosphere as though they were lying
within a stone’s throw of the beach. Around these
bare bluffs of rock, seemingly flung by the hand of
Nature in a sportive mood into the blue waves, lingers
one of the most insidious of all the old Greek legends,
for it was past these lonely cliffs that the cunning
Ulysses sailed during his long career of mazy wanderings
in search of his island home and his faithful
Penelope. In those days, so the Greek bard tells us,
there dwelt upon these islets strange sea-witches
with the faces and forms of most beautiful maidens,
although their lower limbs had the resemblance of
eagles’ feet and talons. Two sirens only, says Homer,
dwelt upon these coasts, although later poets have
increased the number of the fatal sisters to three or
even four. Singing the most enchanting songs to
the sound of tortoise-shell lyres, there used to bask
in the sunlight beside the gentle ripple the Sirens,
their nether limbs well hidden from the gaze of
passing seamen, who, attracted by the tuneful notes,
hastened hither to discover the whereabouts of the
musicians. Innocent eyes, angelic faces, flowing
golden locks and white beckoning hands had every
power to draw the curious mariner nearer and
nearer, until he came within reach of the fell
en<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>chantresses. For the Sirens loved the flesh of
mortals, and bleached skulls and bones of digested
victims lay in heaps upon the sandy floor of their
azure-hued caverns. Gold and jewels, too, the spoils
of many a brave galley that had been lured to destruction
by these charmers, likewise littered their
retreat, and perhaps it was as much the glittering of
this gold as their own lovely features that in certain
cases enticed the wary merchant into this fatal trap.
Gold and a pretty face: what male heart could be
proof against the double temptation the Isles of the
Sirens offered to the navigator in the days of the
Odyssey! Only one sailor over these seas proved
himself a match for the wiles of the cruel goddesses
of the Amalfitan coast; for Ulysses, as we know,
stopped the ears of his companions with wax on
their approach towards this dangerous spot, whilst he
himself, always eager to hear and see everything yet
perfectly well aware of the Sirens’ magnetic power,
had himself tightly bound by cords to the mast. So
whilst the deaf rowers stolidly tugged at their oars,
oblivious of the weird unearthly melody around them,
the clever King of Ithaca gained the honour of becoming
the only mortal who had listened to that
subtle song without paying the penalty of a hideous
and ignoble death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is strangely disappointing to find that no recollection
of Sirens or of Ulysses lingers in the lore
of the present dwellers upon these coasts. They
have no more notion of the aspect of a Siren than
they have of a pleisosaurus, and, as a modern writer
naïvely complains, they are not sharp-witted enough
to invent fanciful tales to please the enquiring foreigner.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Nor is this lack of intelligence to be wondered at,
when we recall to mind the clean sweep of all
classical learning and tradition which that period of
time, truly known as the Dark Ages, made throughout
Italy; if Petrarch found it necessary to explain to
King Robert the Wise with the greatest tact and
delicacy that Vergil was a poet and not a wizard,
what must have been the appalling ignorance prevailing
amongst the peasant and the fisherman? And
yet these barren rocks were known as the Isles of
the Sirens centuries before the verses of the Aeneid
immortalized the mythic voyage of the Trojan
adventurer, who passed along this iron-bound coast
on his way towards the mouth of Tiber. Their
modern, or rather medieval name of I Galli is somewhat
of a puzzle. Erudite scholars affect to derive
it from Guallo, a fortress captured during a war
between King Roger and the Republic of Amalfi,
but this explanation, we confess, does not sound very
reasonable. Others prefer to imagine that the word
Gallo (a cock) contains an allusion to the claws and
feathers of the Sirens themselves, for certain of the
ancient writers endowed these dire Virgins of the
Rocks with the wings as well as the claws of birds;—in
fact, they represented them as Harpies, those
horrible fowls with women’s faces that appeared upon
the scene at Prospero’s bidding to spoil the bad
king’s supper party. But why, if the Sirens were
female,—and on this point all their critics agree with
an unanimity that is wonderful—should their ancient
haunts be called <span class="tei tei-q">“The Cocks?”</span> The untutored
natives themselves, understanding nothing of Sirens
or of Odysseys, hold their own theory with regard
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to the disputed name, which they connect with the
construction of a harbour at distant Salerno, and
though this legend sounds foolish enough, it is
scarcely less flimsy than the notions already quoted.
A certain enchanter, one Pietro Bajalardo, undertook—in
modern parlance, contracted—to build in a
single night the much needed breakwater at Salerno
on the strange condition that all cocks in the
neighbourhood should first be killed; for the wizard,
so the story runs, had a special aversion to Chanticleer
on account of his having caused the repentance
of St Peter by his crowing. In any case, the reigning
Prince of Salerno gladly complied with the eccentric
request, and at his command every cock in or near
the place was accordingly slaughtered, with the
solitary exception of one old rooster, who, being very
dear to the heart of his aged mistress, was kept concealed
beneath a tub and thus escaped the general
holocaust. Throughout the livelong night Bajalardo
was busily engaged in superintending the work of
building the harbour, whilst the fiends who carried
out his behest were actively conveying huge blocks
of broken cliff from the Cape of Minerva to place in
the waters of Salerno. But at daybreak the cock
imprisoned beneath the tub, the sole survivor of his
race, according to natural custom announced the dawn,
to the despair of Bajalardo and the terror of his attendant
fiends, who in their precipitate flight dropped
into the sea near the Punta Sant’ Elia the huge masses
of stone they were then carrying; and these rocks
are called by men I Galli in consequence to this day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, to be strictly impartial, it was not the Sirens
alone who were responsible for all the victims who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>perished on these arid rocks. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Homo homini lupus</span></span>;
man is always ready to prey upon man, and many of
the dark tales concerning the Galli go to prove the
truth of the terrible old adage. At what period the
Sirens abandoned their ancient retreat and swam or
flew away to more congenial haunts is unknown to
history; but certain it is that the rulers of proud
Amalfi committed many a cruel deed of murder or
torture upon their deserted islets. For here, many a
hapless political prisoner languished for years in abject
misery, a prey to the heat and glare of summer and
to the fierce gales of bitter winter nights. Rock-cut
steps and ruined towers still remain as mementoes of
those dark days, when callous human gaolers worthily
filled the places of the absent Sirens. It was in a
chamber of yonder turret, still standing, that the Doge
Mansone II., blinded by a brother’s vengeance, dragged
out years of utter misery in pain and darkness, until
the Emperor of the East, suzerain of Amalfi, at last
took compassion upon the prisoner’s wretched plight
and allowed him to be removed into honourable confinement
at Byzantium. For many hundreds of years
the Isles of the Sirens have lain untenanted, nor are
they visited nowadays save by a few inquisitive
travellers or by the fishermen of the Scaricotojo, who
find safe shelter under their lee during the sudden
squalls of the Mediterranean. For, strange to relate,
there are no dangerous currents, no treacherous whirlpools
close to these rocky islets, such as we might
expect to give some natural interpretation to the ancient
myth, the origin of which remains unexplained and
constitutes a very pretty mystery as it stands.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We bid farewell to the group of ill-omened rocks,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as we proceed rapidly under the rocky slopes of the
Monte di Chiosse towards Positano, which extends in
a long curving line of cheerful-tinted flat-roofed houses
from the summit of its protecting cliff to the strand
below, sprinkled with boats and nets and cloths with
heaps of grain a-drying. The descent to the lower
portion of the little town is singularly charming with
its varied scenery of rocks and hanging woods above
us, with the tiled domes of churches outlined against
the deep blue waters, and with the whole scene
dominated by the pierced crag of Montapertuso,
beyond which thrusts up into the cloudless sky the
triple peak of the giant Sant’ Angelo. Positano is a
thriving as well as an ancient place, and of its dense
population we have abundant evidence in the swarms
of children that pursue our carriage, brown-skinned
picturesque little nuisances, shrilly and incessantly
crying out for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">soldi</span></span>. Most of these infants wear
bright coloured rags, but not a few are dressed in
garments that at once recall the ginger-coloured robes
of the Capuchin friars, for the brothers of the Order
of St Francis are popularly reputed to be especially
competent in keeping aloof evil spells from young
persons entrusted to their charge; and of course,
argue the doting parents, it is only natural that the
spirits of darkness should not dare to molest the little
ones tricked out in robes similar to those worn by
these holy men.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the point of view of history the chief interest
of Positano centres in the time-honoured tradition
that Flavio Gioja, the original inventor of the compass,
was a native of this town, once a flourishing and
important member of the group of cities which
com<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>prised the Amalfitan Republic in its palmy days.
But Clio, the Muse of History, is an inexorable
mistress, and she will not rest content with mere
hearsay, however venerable, and as a result of careful
investigation it would seem that Flavio Gioja, who for
centuries has been generally credited with this marvellous
discovery, must himself have been a personage almost
as mythic as the Sirens of this shore, for his very
name is spelled in a variety of ways that is hopelessly
confusing. Nor has the question of his place of birth
ever been satisfactorily settled, for both Positano and
Amalfi claim this hero of science for a son, although
only in Amalfitan annals can the disputed name
be detected. Be this as it may, it was a citizen of
this Costiera who has ever been acknowledged as
the inventor of the compass, though concerning both
himself and his alleged discovery there is a complete
absence of any contemporary record. Later
writers have, it is true, always admitted the honour on
behalf of the Republic, and Pontano goes so far as to
call Amalfi <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">magnetica</span></span> in compliment thereof, whilst
during the later crusades the Amalfitani, who were
evidently convinced of the genuine nature of Gioja’s
claim, had an heraldic figure of the mariner’s compass
emblazoned on their banners. It seems a thousand
pities to throw doubt upon so picturesque a tradition,
for the date of the invention of the compass has been
fixed as 1302, two years only after the holding of the
famous Papal Jubilee in Rome which Dante’s verse
has described for us. Nor can the ingenious theory
be upheld that the fleur-de-lys, the emblem of the
French kings of Naples, which still decorates the dial
of the compass in almost all lands, is in any wise
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>connected with Carlo il Zoppo, the monarch to whom
Gioja is said to have dedicated his ingenious discovery.
No, we have little doubt that the compass, like so
many of the scientific wonders that crept into Europe
before and during the time of the Renaissance, was
originally brought from the far East, a farther East
than the argosies of Amalfi had ever penetrated. The
little magic box with its moving needle was first used,
it is now admitted, by the cunning merchants of
Cathay during their trading expeditions across the
stony monotonous plains of Central Asia that lay
between the Flowery Land and the civilization of
Persia. From Cathay the use of the magnetic needle
was introduced to the Arab mathematicians of Baghdad
and Cairo, and through them the secret of the lodestone
of China was conveyed to the coast towns of the
Levant. At Aleppo or Alexandria some astute trader
of Amalfi—perhaps his name really was Flavio Gioja—contrived
to learn the new method of steering from
some Moslem or Jewish merchant, and he in his turn
brought this novel and precious piece of information
back to the Italian shores. If, then, a native of
Amalfi did not evolve the idea of the compass out of
his own brain, at least it was the old Republic which
first impressed the Western world with its immense
value, and this, too, at a far earlier period than the
date usually assigned to Gioja’s <span class="tei tei-q">“discovery.”</span> For a
Christian bishop of Jerusalem a hundred years before
Gioja’s day makes mention of the compass as being in
common use amongst the Saracens of Palestine, whilst
its existence was certainly known to Brunetto Latini,
the tutor of Dante, whom for certain moral failings
upon earth his brilliant pupil somewhat harshly places
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in the infernal regions. History has, in short, long
deprived poor disconsolate Positano of its vaunted
glory in the production of a medieval scientist whose
very existence has now become a matter of speculation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As we thread our way along the road that curves
round headland after headland, and is carried over
sheer precipices whose base is lapped by the cool
jade-green water, we begin to realize the essential
difference between the Sorrentine shores we have left
behind us, and the marvellous Costiera d’Amalfi we
are now passing. Ever green and smiling are the
favoured districts that stretch from Castellamare to
Massa Lubrense, with the mountain tops acting
as screens to protect the groves and crops from
the sun’s ardent rays and with the fresh reviving
breezes from the Abruzzi ever breathing upon them.
But here we seem to be under the very eyes of the
Sun-God, who stares fixedly from rising to setting
upon the Amalfitan coast. Welcome enough is this
continuous basking in his smiles during the short
winter days; but oh! the long, long summer hours
wherein King Helios relentlessly pours down his
burning glances upon the shallow soil that covers the
rocky face of the Costiera! We who visit the
territories of the old Republic in winter or early
spring only perceive one aspect of the picture. We
rejoice in the gladdening warmth afforded by unbroken
sunshine and by the complete absence of cutting winds
which Monte Sant’ Angelo’s towering form excludes
from these shores; we note with delight the premature
unfolding of buds and blossoms, and we marvel at the
young fruit of the dark-leaved loquat trees—the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nespoli</span></span> of the South—turning to pale yellow even in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>February. But we cannot realise the blinding glare
and the torrid heat of a July or August, making
a perfect furnace of this sheltered corner, where the
thin layer of cultivated soil, that has been scraped
together painfully by human hands, becomes baked
through and through, when the water-tanks are
exhausted, and when the clouds of thick dust hang like
a pall of white smoke for miles above the sinuous course
of the Corniche road. How close and sweltering must
be the atmosphere of these populous coves, when the
very waves are flung luke-warm upon the hot sand!
How must the inhabitants sigh for a breath of cool
air from the Abruzzi, for the zephyr that tempers the
heat on the Sorrentine plain! <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Carpe diem</span></span>; let us enjoy
the Costiera d’Amalfi in the freshness of early spring-time,
before the oranges and lemons have been stripped
from the leafy groves and before the sun has had
time to scorch up the vegetation that now gives
colour to every cleft and crevice of the rocky
coast-line.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As we advance eastward from Positano we obtain
glimpses from time to time of mountain valleys
thickly clothed with brushwood, and far above
our heads we perceive Agerola perched aloft under
the shadow of the topmost crag of Monte Sant’
Angelo—Agerola, where wolves still haunt the dim
recesses of the chestnut woods, and where the charcoal
burners can tell us of the great grey Were-Wolf that
prowls round the village on stormy nights. Passing
the torrent of the Arriengo and the Punta di San
Pietro with its lonely chapel looking out to sea;
glancing down upon the deep set strand and gloomy
caverns of Furore, and rounding Cape Sottile, we find
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ourselves at Prajano, one of the prettiest spots to
be found on all this wonderful coast. Here we
stop to visit the church of San Luca, which stands on
a little grassy platform overhanging the sea and
commanding a superb view of the Bay of Salerno. It
is a baroque structure of the type common everywhere
in Italy, which travellers are apt to despise without
acknowledging how picturesque this decadent style of
architecture can appear. At Prajano the wooden
doors of green faded to the hue of ancient bronze,
the yellow-washed plaster façade and the lichen-covered
tiles of the roof and tower make up a
charming mass of varied colouring when viewed
against the broad blue band of sea and sky beyond.
Within, the church is mean and tawdry, just a

but the afternoon sun struggling through the curtains
that cover its fantastic windows allows a mellow light
to fill the expanse of the building. A toothless
old woman and a young girl, both of them thinly and
poorly clad, are the sole occupants of the church, and
they are evidently too much absorbed in prayer to
notice our presence. They have placed beside the
Madonna’s altar lighted tapers which glimmer feebly
in a shaft of strong sunlight that falls through a rent
in the curtain overhead. For what purpose, we
wonder, have these candles been bought out of a
scanty store! Are they burning on behalf of some
sailor-boy now being tossed upon the ocean? Or are
they offered to obtain some boon more selfish and less
pathetic? At any rate, this pair of intent worshippers,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>representing fresh Southern youth and crabbed age,
make up a pretty picture as they kneel together
on the pavement of tiles ornamented in bright rococo
patterns to represent the coat-of-arms of some
forgotten noble benefactor: it is too simple and everyday
a sight in Italy to offer a theme for verse, too
sacred a subject for an idle photograph. We leave
the church on tip-toe, and return to the terrace with
its low marble seats and its stunted acacia trees to sit
a few moments before re-entering the carriage.

Skirting the Capo di Conca we obtain our first
sight of proud Amalfi, and we realize that our drive,
long in distance perhaps, but all too short with its
varied beauties and interests, is drawing to a close.
Nearer and nearer do we approach our goal, the shining
turrets of the Cathedral tower acting as our beacon,
until at length our chariot clatters beneath the echoing
tunnel hewn in the cliff that leads into the town itself.

The traveller’s first impressions of Amalfi, which
is essentially the beauty-spot of the Riviera of
Naples, are usually associated with the old Capuchin
convent, long since turned into a hotel and now the
bourne of most visitors to this coast. Its arcaded
façade and its terraced garden stand on a plateau
seemingly cut out of the sheer face of the cliff, whilst
high above the town the lofty barren rocks enfold the
Convent and its verdant demesne within a natural
amphitheatre and protect this sunny paradise from the
keen blasts of winter. A flight of steps zigzagging
up the rocky hill-side connects the building with the
high road below; whilst a narrow pathway, leading
between stone walls and now passing beneath dark
mysterious archways, wherein the lamps burning
before the Madonna’s shrines afford a welcome light
even at midday, descends by steep gradients from the
garden above into the main piazza of the little city.
Built by the celebrated Cardinal Pietro Capuano nearly
seven hundred years ago for Cistercian monks, the
monastery in the sixteenth century came into the possession
of the Capuchin Friars, those brown-robed
figures that with their bare feet and girdles of knotted
white cord are such familiar and picturesque objects
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in the daily crowds of every Italian town. But the
friars have been forced to abandon their airy retreat
ever since the suppression of the religious houses, which
succeeded the union of the old Neapolitan kingdom
with young Italy, and their convent has long been
put to secular uses. Yet the old monastic church
still exists, and superstitious people declare that the
spectral forms of ejected Capuchins are sometimes to
be seen advancing slowly up the rocky ascent in order
to revisit the sacred building that is now closed for
worship. Nevertheless the church is cared for by the
members of the Vozzi family, its present owners, who
every Christmas-tide still prepare the popular <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">presepio</span></span>,
that curious representation of the scene in the stable at
Bethlehem, wherein a score of gaily dressed figures of
painted wood represent the Holy Family and the
worshipping peasants. Little in fact has been changed
within the building itself, and the exquisite cloistered
court with its slender intertwining Saracenic columns
still remains to delight alike the artist and the antiquary.
We say <span class="tei tei-q">“still remains”</span> advisedly; for beyond the
tiny quadrangle our eyes at once light upon a scene
of hideous devastation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Doubtless many persons will recall the great land-slip
of December 1899, when almost without warning
the whole face of the rocky headland that shelters
Amalfi on the west tore itself loose and slid with a
crash like thunder into the sea below, overwhelming
in its fall the little inn known as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Santa Caterina”</span>
and burying in its ruins two English ladies and several
fishermen. The sinister scar still continues as a blot
upon the lovely landscape, speaking only too eloquently
to all of sudden death and destruction amidst the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>surrounding scenes of life and beauty. The older
portion of the Capuchin convent, by a miracle as it
were, escaped the on-rush of the land-slide, but its
famous <span class="tei tei-q">“Calvary,”</span> the large group of the Crucifixion
that appears prominently in so many pictures of
Amalfi, was completely swept away, so that the boatmen
from the sands below can no longer behold the
immense vivid representation of the Last Agony which
was wont to greet their upturned eyes. Already
Time’s kindly hand has begun to drape the scene of
the catastrophe with a decent mourning veil of grey
and green, for the hardy succulent plants that can withstand
the sun’s fierce rays and can thrive despite the
boisterous salt sea-winds are already sprouting from
every crack and cranny of the riven earth. Perhaps
it is as well for us selfish and self-satisfied mortals to
possess a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">memento mori</span></span> close at hand in a spot so
teeming with the joy of life; yet somehow the first
sight of that mass of broken headland and the dark
ominous fissure in the hill-side, flung across the sunlit
scene, is apt to send a slight shiver through the frame
of the beholder.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are three indisputable advantages to be gained
by turning a suppressed religious house into a modern
hotel, so a cunning old Italian inn-keeper once confided
to us; that is, of course, provided one is not afraid of the
proverbial curse that clings to the buying of any of the
Church’s sequestrated property. These three things are
good air, good water, and lovely views; benefits that
a layman is fully as competent to understand as
any cloistered ecclesiastic. And certainly the worthy
Vozzi are fully justified in offering these privileges
to their guests at the Albergo Cappuccini. Signor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Vozzi! How many travellers in the South recall with
infinite pleasure their host’s tall commanding figure,
his snowy drooping whiskers, the sun-shade that was
rarely out of his hand, his old-fashioned courteous
manners, and his famous family of cats, whereof the
coal-black Nerone was the prime favourite, a feline
monster almost as tyrannical as his Imperial namesake
of evil reputation. Signor Vozzi’s striking personality,
the sable fur of agate-eyed Nerone, the eternal sunshine,
and the wide all-embracing views over sea and land,
are somehow all jumbled together in our perplexed
mind, as it recurs to the many days spent beneath
the convent roof. Nay, not beneath the roof! For
we were wont to pass the whole day, even the short
December day, in basking on the warm sheltered
terrace and peering over the busy beach and the
dazzling waters below, whereon the tale of Amalfitan
fisher-life could be read as it were from the pages of
a book.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Somehow the old monastic buildings appear
marvellously well adapted to modern needs. The
former inmates’ cells, wherein the brown-robed brethren
of the Order of St Francis until lately were wont to
pass their placid uneventful lives, afford comfortable if
somewhat limited accommodation; whilst the covered
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">loggia</span></span> that runs the whole length of the cells has been
turned into a series of delightful little sitting-rooms,
their broad arc-shaped windows facing full south, a
boon that only a winter resident in Italy can properly
appreciate. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dove non entra il sole, entra il medico</span></span>, is
a hackneyed but well-proven adage; consequently
here in the old Capuchin convent the services of the
local medicine-man ought rarely to be required.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Signor Vozzi’s guests partake of their meals in the
ancient refectory, a large bare echoing chamber with a
vaulted ceiling, which still contains the old stone pulpit
from which in more pious days a grave brother was
wont to read aloud choice passages from the works of
the early Fathers of the Church or of St Bonaventura,
the Seraphic Doctor of the Franciscans, during the
hours allotted to the frugal repasts of the friars. But
the public rooms and the cool white-washed corridors
do not present such attractions as the glorious garden
with its famous <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pergola</span></span> and its views of the Bay.
Here even in Christmas week we found quantities of
plants in full bloom: the delicate yellow blossoms of
the Soffrana rose; trailing ivy-leaved geraniums with
gay heads of carmine flowers; the honey-scented
budleia with its little globes of dark yellow flowerets:
clumps of gorgeous scarlet salvia; and straggling
masses of the pretty cosmia, red, pink and white.
Humming-bird hawk-moths darted hither and thither
in the sunshine, restless little creatures whose wings
are never for a moment still, as they poise gracefully
over each separate blossom in turn. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pergola</span></span>
itself, which every artist at Amalfi paints as a matter
of course, generally with a Capuchin friar—at least a
friar <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro hac vice</span></span>—or a pretty dark-eyed damsel in the
native costume, sitting in the foreground, was certainly
bare of foliage, we admit, for even in the soft warm air
of the Bay of Salerno the grape-vine wisely refuses to
burst into leaf at Yuletide, no matter how enticing the
warmth. But the thick white pillars and their wooden
cross-beams, around which are entwined the leafless
coiling limbs of the sleeping vine, throw dark blue
patterns of chequered shadow upon the sunlit ground.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Above the terraced garden rises the orangery, well
watered by many artificial rillets, and from the midst
of the orange and lemon trees there emerges a path
leading to the entrancing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bosco</span></span>, or grove, that fills the
deep hollow space formed by the sheltering cliffs
behind. It was mid-winter, as we have said, yet pink
cyclamens and strong-scented double narcissi were
blooming freely, whilst from the dark boughs of the
ilex trees overhead there fell upon the ear the pleasant
twittering of innumerable birds, for happily the cruel
snare and the gun are strictly forbidden in this sacred
spot, so that his <span class="tei tei-q">“little sisters, the birds,”</span> that the
gentle Saint of Assisi loved so tenderly, can still sing
their songs of innocence and build their nests in peace
amidst the trees that no longer remain the property of
the great humanitarian Order. At nightfall this
garden is almost equally beautiful beneath a star-lit
sky and with the many lamps of the town below
throwing long bars of yellow light upon the placid
waters of the Bay. As we pace the long terrace,
wrapped in the glory of a million stars and revelling
in the exalted yet fairy-like loveliness of the scene
around us, we perceive the mellow night air to be
redolent of a strange but fascinating perfume. It is
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">olea fragrans</span></span>, the humble inconspicuous oriental
shrub that from its clusters of tiny white flowers is
thus giving out its secret soul at the falling of the
night dews, and permeating the whole garden with
its marvellous floral incense. But if the star-lit,
flower-scented nights of Amalfi are to be accounted as
exquisite memories, how much more glorious and
exhilarating is the rising of the sun, as he appears in
full majesty of crimson and gold above the classic hills
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that overlook Paestum to the east! Leaning at early
dawn from the windows of the Cappuccini, we have
watched the sky flush at the first caress of <span class="tei tei-q">“rosy-fingered
Eôs”</span> and seen the fragment of the waning
moon turn to silver at the approach of the burning
God of Day, still tarrying behind the lofty barrier of
the capes and mountains of the Lucanian shore.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dead, alas! For the old liberties of the great
Republic of Amalfi have been extinct for more than
half a thousand years, and it is in consequence difficult
for us to realise that the quaint noisy squalid
picturesque little city by the sea-shore, huddled into
the narrow gorge of the Canneto, is that self-same
Amalfi whose navies rode triumphant over the
Mediterranean before the days of the Early Crusades.
Yet Amalfi, which may be reckoned amongst the
first-born of that fair family of medieval cities that
their prolific parent the land of Italy brought forth in
an age of darkness, was also the foremost to droop and
die, her glories scattered and passed before Florence had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ceased to be an obscure country town. In this case
History presents to us a most forcible, not to say
an unique example of the origin, rise and decline of
a power, all occurring within a short space of time.
Amalfi springs, as it were, out of the void as a city
of importance, for no Roman colony occupied its
site in antique times. Its very nomenclature is a
puzzle to scholars, and the usual statement that it
owed its name to Byzantine settlers coming hither
from the ancient town of Melfi in the Basilicata does
not sound very convincing, though for want of a
better theory it must suffice. Why, when, and by
whom the city was in reality founded remains an
enigma, yet we learn from a passage in one of the
letters of St Gregory the Great that the place was of
sufficient size to be governed by a bishop in the
sixth century. By the tenth we find the Republic
of Amalfi already risen to a position of commanding
importance, and holding its own against the rival
states between which its territories were wedged;
the dukedom of Naples to the west and the principality
of Salerno to eastward. Dexterously playing on the
greed and prejudices of the various tyrants who ruled
Naples and Salerno, and occasionally allying itself
with them in order to repel the fierce attacks of their
common enemy, the Saracenic hordes who were then
harrying the Lucanian coast, Amalfi continued to
uphold its political freedom and dignity in the face
of immense difficulties. And in gratitude for the
vigour with which the Amalfitani had waged war
against the infidel invaders, Pope Leo IV. in course
of time conferred upon the Duke or Doge, the chief
magistrate of the Republic, the title of <span class="tei tei-q">“Defender of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the Faith.”</span> Nominally under the suzerainty of the
Greek Emperor at Constantinople, Amalfi was
practically independent; its system of government
was conducted on lines somewhat akin to those of
aristocratic Venice; its population is said to have
exceeded fifty thousand in the capital city alone; its
boundaries extended from the Promontory of Minerva
on the west to the town of Cetara upon the confines
of Salerno; whilst many daughter-towns of wealth
and importance, such as Scala and Ravello, sprang
into being within the narrow limits of the sea-girt
republic. Owning a small and by no means fertile
extent of land, the inhabitants of Amalfi from its
earliest days were forced to become merchants and
sailors; to use a modern phrase, the Amalfitani came
to possess a complete monopoly of trade with Eastern
lands, both Christian and Mahommedan. It was
the ships of the Republic that alone brought to the
shores of Italy the rich stuffs, the gold and silver
embroideries, the dried fruits and the strange birds
and beasts of Asia Minor and Arabia, and in exchange
for their oriental merchandise obtained an abundance
of corn, wine, oil, meat and other commodities of life
that their beautiful but somewhat sterile dominions
were unable to supply to an ever increasing population.
But it was not only the material products of the East
that the sailors of Amalfi conveyed to Europe in
their home-bound argosies; for they brought back
with them the rudiments of arts and sciences that
distracted Italy had well-nigh forgotten during the
period of the barbarian invasions. Through the
merchant princes of Amalfi, the secrets of astronomy,
of mathematics and of scientific navigation were
re-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>introduced into the land that had almost lost its old
Roman civilization. A priceless manuscript of that
great code of laws, the Pandects, which a Byzantine
Emperor, the famous Justinian, had caused to be
compiled with such skill and labour, putting into
concise and accurate form the collected wisdom of
generations of Roman jurists, was included amongst
the treasures of the East that were borne back to
Italy in the Republic’s vessels. And in addition to
restoring the old Roman jurisprudence to its original
home, the city of Amalfi had the honour of promulgating
the celebrated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tabula Amalphitana</span></span>, the new
maritime laws that were henceforth destined to
regulate the whole commercial system of the western
world. No marvel then that the poet William of
Apulia should praise in unmeasured terms the glories
of the new-sprung city, whose trade extended to the
shores of India and whose merchants possessed
independent settlements in every great city of the
Levant.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A small state on a barren shore, yet the holder
of the balance between East and West by means of
its wide-spread commerce, such was Amalfi during
the tenth and eleventh centuries. In some respects
this Republic of the Middle Ages appears as the
prototype of the Venice of the Renaissance, for there
is not a little in common between the city that was
built upon the marshy islets of the Adriatic lagoons,
and the city that was erected at the base of the
treacherous cliffs of the Tyrrhene Sea. Solely by
means of commerce both foundations rose from
nothingness to splendour and power: both held the
gorgeous East in fee; and both fell lamentably from
their high estate. The chief point of difference in
this comparison of their careers is obvious; Amalfi
collapsed suddenly and utterly, whilst the Queen of
the Adriatic has sunk gradually to decay until she
has become the interesting monument of a vanished
magnificence which we admire to-day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was the rising naval power of Pisa that finally
crushed the greatness of Amalfi, although the Republic
had already entered into its days of decline when
Robert Guiscard at the time of the First Crusade had
temporarily annexed its dominions to his new principality.
Some thirty years later King Roger of
Naples forcibly seized the whole of the Costiera
d’Amalfi, allowing the citizens to retain their own form
of government. Four years after this, the Pisan fleet,
coming to aid the people of Naples against King
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Roger, utterly destroyed the once vaunted navy of
Amalfi, and sacked both the city itself and the two
hill-set towns of Scala and Ravello. Its political
liberty had already been crushed by the Normans,
and now its ships and its wealth were dissipated by
the Pisans; it was a double measure of ignominy
and disaster from which Amalfi never recovered.
Amidst its humiliations and sorrows, the stricken city
had also to mourn the loss of its greatest treasure, its
secular <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">palladium</span></span>, that most precious copy of the
Pandects of Justinian, which the Pisan marauders
seized and carried back with them to their city
on the Arno. Here in Pisa the famous volume
remained in safe keeping for some three hundred
years, and then, as Time’s round brought its inevitable
vengeance on the plunderers of Amalfi, it was removed
by the victorious Florentines to their own city. So
intense a veneration for the book itself now manifested
itself amongst the scholars and students of Florence,
that at one period offerings of incense were often made
to the inscribed wisdom of past ages as to a most
holy relic of some Saint, and the clerk or jurist about
to peruse its faded characters was wont, first of all, to
breathe a prayer of genuine gratitude on his knees for
the preservation of this ancient book. Amalfi, Pisa,
Florence, each in its turn has owned the guardianship
of this most famous literary jewel, which is to-day
jealously guarded as the chief treasure of the world-renowned
Laurentian Library.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is true that the prosperity of Amalfi did not
disappear immediately after the inroad of the Pisans,
for Boccaccio, writing in the fourteenth century, still
speaks of the ancient territory of the destroyed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Republic as <span class="tei tei-q">“a rocky ridge beside a smiling sea,
which its inhabitants call the Costa d’Amalfi; full of
little cities, of gardens, of fountains, and of rich and
enterprising merchants.”</span> It was in fact reserved for
relentless Nature herself to complete the work of destruction
that Norman armies and Pisan fleets had
more than half accomplished. We have already
spoken of the terrible land-slips to which this beautiful
shore is eminently subject, even at the present
day, as the mass of wreckage outside the old Capuchin
convent only too clearly testifies. In the year 1343,
during the progress of a storm of exceptional fury, of
which the poet Petrarch has left us a vivid account in
one of his letters, the greater part of the devoted city
was swept away by a tidal wave. The whole line of
quays stretching from the headland by the Cappuccini
to the point of Atrani on the east, together with
churches, palaces, and warehouses, was now swallowed
up by the surging waters and engulfed for ever in the
depths of the sea; and thus the very element that
had brought wealth, power, and prosperity to Amalfi
in the past now proved the direct cause of her final
calamity. With this fearful cataclysm of Nature
following upon the heels of its political extinction, we
can hardly wonder at the rapid decline of this
<span class="tei tei-q">“Athens of the Middle Ages,”</span> whose population has
now sunk to about one seventh part of the 50,000
citizens it once boasted in the far distant days of her
maritime supremacy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Reflecting upon the famous past of this ancient
city, let us descend the steep pathway from the terrace
of the Cappuccini to visit the crowded beach below.
Here we find ourselves in the midst of a cheerful
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>animated throng, engaged in mending nets, in painting
boats, and in other occupations connected with a sea-faring
life. The tall fantastic houses with balconied
windows that line the curve of the sea-shore, the
glistening sands and the brown-legged, gay-capped
fishermen, combine to present a charming picture of
southern Italian life, so that we could gladly linger in
observing the ever-changing scenes of life and industry.
But we cannot tarry long, for the ubiquitous beggars
who have begun to pester us ever since we passed the
hotel gates have meantime dogged our descending
footsteps, and their forces have been recruited on the
way hither by many willing assistants. No doubt
the vast majority of the Amalfitani are hard working
and self-respecting, for the little town possesses
maccaroni factories and old-established paper mills
of no small importance, yet it is obvious that a
considerable portion of the total population and at
least one-half of all the children spend their whole
time in demanding alms of strangers. Before, behind,
and from a distance arises the ceaseless cry of
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Qual co’ signor’! Fame! Fame!</span></span>”</span> in hateful tones
of make-belief misery, and these whining appeals are
aided by all the expressive pantomimic gestures of
the South. You are placed on the horns of a dilemma:
give, and the report that a generous and fabulously
wealthy Signore has arrived in Amalfi will run like
wild-fire through the whole place, and your life in
consequence will become an absolute burden for the
remainder of your sojourn in this spot. Refuse, and
the wretches who have hitherto been wheedling and
cringing at your heels, will at once grow insolent and
threatening, especially in the case of unprotected
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ladies. It is in fact a choice of two evils, and the
only remedy that we ourselves can suggest is for the
persecuted traveller to select a good stout larrikin and
pay him freely to keep at arm’s length his detestable
brothers and sisters in professional beggary. But the
uninitiated usually endure these odious importunities
for a certain length of time, and then, exasperated by
the unchecked mendicancy of the place, at last fly
precipitately from this beautiful shore, to seek comparative
peace and freedom elsewhere. For it is
useless to argue; it is foolish, even dangerous to
grow angry. <span class="tei tei-q">“Why should we give to you?”</span> we
asked one day in desperation of a particularly persistent
woman. <span class="tei tei-q">“Because,”</span> was the unabashed and
impudent but unanswerable reply, <span class="tei tei-q">“you have much,
and I have nothing!”</span> Driven by these human pests
from the sunlit strand, we make our way through the
busy piazza, where peasant women with piles of fruit
and vegetables make a glowing mass of colour around
the central fountain below St Andrew’s statue, and
proceed towards the Valley of the Mills. A different
phase of Amalfitan life now greets us, for here are to
be found the hard-working bees of this human hive,
and it must be confessed their ways make an agreeable
change from the habits of the pestering drones that
infest the beach and the neighbourhood of the hotels.
The whole of the steep rocky gorge of that tiny
torrent the Canneto is full of mills, each emitting a
whirring sound which mingles with the continual
plash of the water as it descends in miniature
cascades the full length of the ravine, providing in its
headlong course towards the sea the motive power
required to turn all this quantity of machinery.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Bridges span the Canneto at several points, whilst
either bank is occupied by tiny factories of paper or
soap, and by winding stone stair-ways that lead upward
to terraces contrived to catch the sunshine for
the purpose of drying the goods. The whole valley,
with its strong contrasting effects of sun and shade
and its varied atmosphere of intense heat and of
chilly dampness, is full of seething picturesque
humanity. The combined sounds of creaking wheels,
of falling water and of human chattering are almost
deafening within this narrow echo-filled gorge, above
which in the far distance we catch a glimpse of rocky
heights with the town of Scala perched eyrie-like
against the deep blue of the sky overhead. Pretty
laughing girls, bare-footed and with marvellously
white teeth, emerge from the open door-ways to
smile pleasantly at us, for the workers of the Valle
de’ Molini are thoroughly accustomed to the presence
of strangers in their midst. Half-naked men, who
have stepped for a moment out of the hot rooms of
the maccaroni factories in order to breathe the fresh
air, regard us with calm disdain and without any
seeming interest. Our presence is tolerated, even if
our reception excites no feelings of surprise or
cordiality, so that we are allowed to pursue our walk
up the ever-narrowing valley in peace and comfort
and to admire at our leisure the wonderfully
beautiful effects of colouring produced by the
cascades of purple-stained water, the graceful forms
and gay dresses of the girls, and the peeps of fruit-laden
orange trees above fern-clad walls. And how
dark the people are! For though black eyes and
hair are commonly associated with the Italian race,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>yet in the North we find abundant evidence of the
admixture of Teutonic blood, whilst in the South the
fair-haired Norman settlers have left indelible marks
of their conquest of Naples and Sicily in many blue-eyed
and white-skinned descendants; but here in
Amalfi a blonde complexion seems to be absolutely
unknown. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Com’ è bianco! Com’ è bianco!</span></span>”</span> called
out one of a party of girls with swarthy skin and
ebon hair and tresses, who languidly came out to
stare at us, as we wended our way slowly up the
Valley of the Mills.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the chief pride of Amalfi, and indeed its sole
surviving fragment of departed magnificence, is the
Cathedral, dedicated to St Andrew the Apostle, who
is patron of the city. A broad flight of steps, flanked
on either side by the Archbishop’s Palace and the
residence of the Canons, leads to a platform covered
by a most beautiful Gothic <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">loggia</span></span> set with richly
traceried windows and upheld by antique marble
columns. At its northernmost angle we see springing
into the blue aether the tall graceful red-and-white
striped campanile, surmounted by its barbaric-looking
green-tiled cupola and pinnacles. Facing the top of
the steps are the two magnificent doors, specially
designed in distant Byzantium to embellish this
church more than eight hundred years ago, and cast
by the famous artist in bronze, Staurachios. Two
Latin inscriptions, incised in letters of silver upon the
baser metal, relate to the world that one Pantaleone,
son of Maurice, caused this work to be undertaken
in honour of the holy Apostle Andrew, in
order that he might obtain pardon for the sins he
had committed whilst upon earth. These glorious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gates were the gifts to their native city of members
of the family of Pantaleone of Amalfi, merchant
princes who had amassed an immense fortune by
trade in the Levant. They are splendid specimens of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">niello</span></span> work, which consisted in ornamenting a surface
of bronze by engraving upon it lines that were
subsequently filled in with coloured enamel or with
some precious metal. These portals of Amalfi,
perhaps the earliest example in Southern Italy of
this rare form of art, are divided into panels adorned
with Scriptural subjects simply and quaintly treated,
wherein the stiff attitudes of the figures and the
many long straight lines introduced testify plainly
enough to their Byzantine origin and workmanship.
As we enter the cool dark incense-scented building,
we note that though cruelly maltreated by the
baroque enthusiasts of the eighteenth century, the
general effect of the interior is still impressive with
its rows of ancient pillars and its richly decorated
roof. On all sides marble fragments with exquisite
reliefs meet the eye, spoils evidently filched from the
abandoned city of Paestum across the Salernian Bay
and presented to the church by the Norman conquerors
of Amalfi. After inspecting the classical bas-reliefs,
we descend into the ancient crypt, which well-meaning
artists have completely encased with a covering of
precious marbles and garish frescoes of the Neapolitan
school. It is a place of more than local sanctity,
this modernized crypt, for the possession of the relics
of the Apostle which Cardinal Capuano proudly
brought hither after the sack of Constantinople in the
early years of the thirteenth century, was considered
by many to constitute a sufficient recompense to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Amalfi for her lost independence. Popes and
sovereigns were in the habit of approaching the
shrine, and the number of these illustrious visitors
includes the names of St Francis of Assisi, Pope
Urban IV., the holy St Bridget of Sweden, and
the notorious Queen Joanna II. of Naples. Aeneas
Silvius Piccolomini, afterwards Pope Pius II., however,
seems to have thought Amalfi, ever dwindling
in size and importance, too mean a place to own so
great a treasure, and he accordingly transported the
head of the Saint to Rome, where it is now accounted
amongst the four chief relics of St Peter’s. Perhaps
it was to counterbalance the loss of so important a
member of the Saint’s anatomy, that in the succeeding
century there arose a report which spoke of the
rescue of certain relics of the Apostle Andrew during
the headlong course of the Reformation in Scotland.
The most precious objects preserved in the Cathedral
of St Andrew’s, says this legend, were secretly saved
from the expected fury of Knox’s partisans and
brought to Amalfi, where they were reverently added
to the store of remains that had survived the plundering
of Pius II. Whether or no there be any truth in
this somewhat fantastic theory, it is enough to state
that St Andrew continues to be patron Saint of this
maritime city, for which office the character of the
Galilean fisherman who was called to be a fisher
of men seems specially appropriate. Nevertheless,
despite the valuable additions made in Reformation
days, the sanctity of the shrine is not held so high
as it used to be. No longer do the venerated bones
ooze with the sweet-scented moisture that in medieval
days was piously collected to be used for purposes so
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>varied as the curing of warts, or the scattering of
Paynim fleets! Yet so late as the days of Tasso,
the great Apostle himself was evidently connected in
the popular mind with the performance of so bizarre
a miracle:—
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em; margin-left: 1.80em; margin-top: 0.90em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Vide in sembianza placida e tranquilla</span></span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-size: 90%">Il Divo, che di manna Amalfi instilla.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But although the present times are too sinful to
allow of the distillation of the fragrant dew of Amalfi,
we observe the kneeling forms of not a few intent
worshippers within the dimly-lighted crypt, in the
midst of which the Spaniard Naccarino’s bronze figure
of the Apostle uprises with dignified mien and life-like
attitude. Sant’ Andrea is still <span class="tei tei-q">“Il Divo,”</span> the tutelary
god of the Amalfitani; he remains in the estimation
of these simple ignorant folk the special protector of
the community. Times and ideas change, but not the
old deep-rooted feeling of a personal tie between the
Saint and his favoured people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We were lucky in happening upon the great popular
festival of Sant’ Andrea during our visit to Amalfi,
and consequently were enabled not only to witness a
picturesque scene of considerable splendour, but also
to observe how strong a devotion the Amalfitani still
manifest towards their own especial Saint. With the
first flush of early dawn, discharges of mortars from
the beach and the neighbouring hills began to arouse
the echoes and to remind the still slumbering population
that once more the great anniversary had arrived.
The world was quickly astir to do honour to the great
St Andrew, and from a very early hour an interminable
stream of peasants and villagers, young and old, male
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and female, began to enter the town from all quarters,
and to congregate in the piazza where stands the large
fountain crowned by the Saint’s own effigy. Here
with exemplary patience the throng waited until the
hour of the ceremony in the Cathedral drew nigh.
Within the huge building priests and lay-helpers were
actively employed in preparing for the event, and by
their exertions the whole interior had been transformed
into what may be best described as a magnificent
ball-room, for every blank wall had been covered
with draperies of rich crimson damask and the very
pillars had been swathed from base to capital in the
same gorgeous material. Innumerable old cut-glass
chandeliers, that had reposed since the last <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">festa di
Sant’ Andrea</span></span> in huge round boxes in some secluded
vault, had been slung by means of cords from the
ceiling and the arches of the nave, whilst a large
number of mirrors set in carved gilt frames had been
affixed to various points of the walls and columns.
The fine marble pavement lay thickly strewn with bay
and myrtle leaves, emitting a pleasant wholesome
scent when crushed under foot by the picturesque but
somewhat malodorous crowd of fisher-folk and
peasants. On entering the church, at the first sound
of the bells booming over head, we found ourselves
heavily pressed by the surging throng of worshippers,
and it was only with difficulty we could obtain a sight
of the ceremonies at the high altar, prominent upon
which stood the silver bust of the Apostle containing
the precious relics. It was a typical Italian <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">festa</span></span>.
The chanting was harsh and discordant; the antiquated
inharmonious organ emitted unexpected squeals, as if
in positive pain; there was, it is needless to add, a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>complete absence of that <span class="tei tei-q">“churchy”</span> demeanour which
passes for reverence in the North; yet withal, despite
the shrill discordant music, the tawdry embellishments
of the grand old building and the absence of propriety
of the crowd, there was perceptible some mysterious
underlying force that compelled us to note the extraordinary
hold the Church has upon the people of
Southern Italy. For all this throng of persons had
assembled that day with one definite purpose: to see
their universal friend and patron, their Saint and their
worker of domestic miracles; they had come to pay
their homage to a celestial acquaintance, with whom,
thanks to the Church’s teaching, they had all been
intimate from their cradles. They had not thus
assembled at an early hour, deserting their mills and
their shops, their boats and their nets, renouncing their
chances of gain, to hear a preacher’s eloquence or to
listen to fine music, but merely to pay their annual
visit of respect to their Spiritual Master. Why should
we aliens intrude upon so private a gathering? In
any case, we have grown weary of standing in the
close sickly atmosphere, wherein the fragrance of the
crushed bay-leaves, the fumes of incense and the strange
smell of garlic-eating humanity blend in an oppressive
manner. We push our way through the eager and
intent congregation, and gaining the door-way step
with a sigh of relief into the sunshine that is flooding
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">loggia</span></span>. But it is too hot to remain here, and we
descend the great stair-case in order to take up a post
of vantage in the shade on the opposite side of the
piazza; having gained our desired position we expect
in patience the arrival of the procession. Nor have
we very long to wait. The officials of the town
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>suddenly dart forward to clear the steps of their crowd
of ragged children, and almost simultaneously the
great bronze doors of Pantaleone are flung open to the
sweet air and the sunshine. It was a wonderful and
deeply interesting experience to watch the glittering
train slowly emerge from the darkness of the church
into the glare of day, and then descend that stately
flight of marble stairs to the sound of joy-bells and to
the accompaniment of explosions of fireworks. First
came the leading members of the various Confraternities
of the little city, all bearing tapers whose
tongues of flame shone feebly in the fierce contemptuous
sunlight, and all wearing snow-white smocks and
coloured scarves. Red, green, blue, white, purple,
yellow, gleamed the huge banners of these different
societies, each borne by a tall <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vessillifero</span></span>, or standard
bearer, assisted by quaint solemn little figures who
acted as pages. Then followed the body of the clergy
in copes of white and gold, with eyes downcast as
they chaunted in loud nasal tones from books in their
hands; next came the Canons of the Cathedral in fine
old festal vestments reserved for such occasions and
with mitres on their heads, for Amalfi clings to the
ancient ecclesiastical privileges that were granted in
distant days when Florence and Venice were little
more than villages. Last of all walked the Archbishop,
an aged tottering figure, weighed down by his cope of
cloth of gold and seemingly crushed beneath his
immense jewelled mitre. Two lackeys, almost as
infirm as their venerable master, and clad in threadbare
liveries edged with armorial braid, were in close
attendance, whilst behind the Archbishop, beneath a
gorgeous canopy of state upheld by six white-robed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>assistants, was borne the great silver bust of St Andrew.
The appearance of the Image of <span class="tei tei-q">“Il Divo,”</span> upon
which the sunbeams were playing in dazzling coruscations
of light, was greeted with a murmur of applause
and satisfaction from the expectant crowd in the open.
Hats were doffed; knees were bent; prayers were
muttered, as with slow and cautious steps the bearers
of the Image and its canopy began to descend.
Having gained the lower ground in safety, a momentary
halt was made, during which we were able to note
the mass of votive offerings—jewels, chains, rings,
watches, seals—suspended round the Saint’s neck,
amongst them being many silver fishes, doubtless the
gifts of grateful mariners. And at this point we were
spectators of a pretty incident. A little girl with
black ringlets and eager eyes was dexterously lifted on
to her father’s shoulder, in order that she might present
<span class="tei tei-q">“Il Divo”</span> with a golden chain, which the tiny fingers
deftly clasped round the bejewelled neck of the silver
bust. The crowd saw and applauded; it was a moment
of triumph for the dark-eyed child, for the Church, and
for the approving throng. With the new addition of
the child’s necklet to the treasury of the Saint, the
procession pursued its way through the square towards
the Valley of the Mills, with banners waving, with
priests chaunting in harsh monotonous tones, and with
clouds of incense rising into the sun-kissed air. It
was truly a beautiful and curious sight, this festival of
the Church amidst people so devout and surroundings
so appropriate.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On his safe return to his now brilliantly lighted
Cathedral, the Saint was welcomed with indescribable
enthusiasm. The crazy old organ was made to
pro<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>duce the loudest and liveliest of music; the uniformed
municipal band awoke the echoes of the venerable
but bedizened fabric with its complimentary braying;
and urchins were even permitted to scatter fire-crackers
upon the floor in honour of the event. It was a real
ecclesiastical Saturnalia of a most innocent and joyous
description. All Amalfi spent the remaining hours of
day-light in feasting, dancing and singing, and when
at last darkness fell upon the merry scene, rockets
and Roman candles were seen to spring into the
night air from many points in the landscape, illumining
the sea with quickly dying trails of coloured light.
Watching the bonfires and the fireworks, and listening
to the sounds of revelry and song arising from the
town below, we pondered over our experiences of the
day as we paced our airy terrace of the Cappuccini.
Surely the South has remained immutable for
centuries in its deeply rooted love of religious
festivals. The forefathers of these devotees of Andrew
the Fisherman were equally enthusiastic worshippers
of Poseidon or of Apollo. The Church has not in
reality altered the outer attributes; it has but added
a special moral significance to the old pagan gatherings.
The ancient gods of Greece and Rome are
dethroned, and their very names forgotten by the
populace; but their cult survives, for it has been
adapted to the glorification of Christian Saints. True
it is that the milk-white sacrificial oxen and the gay
garlands of antiquity have been omitted; nevertheless,
there remain the music, the incense and the unrestrained
jollity of the people. Much that is beautiful
and suggestive has perished, yet there survives enough
of the old classical ritual for us to see that the true
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>spirit of antiquity has never wholly died out amongst
these sunburnt children of Magna Graecia.

No visit to Amalfi can be considered complete
without ascending to the decayed town of
Ravello, that crowns the rocky heights to the north-east
of the parent city by the sea-shore. The road
thither leads along the beach, passing between the
picturesque old convent that is now the Hotel Luna,
beloved of artists, and the solitary watch tower on
the precipice which stands sentinel above the waters
on our right hand. At this point we turn the corner,
and find ourselves in Atrani, lying in the deep gorge
of the Dragone and joining its buildings to those of
Amalfi on the road above the beach. Prominent
upon the steep ridge that separates the two cities
stands the ruined keep of Pontone, the last relic of
the town of Scaletta that was a flourishing place in
days of the Republic. A tall belfry of peculiar and
striking architecture which dominates Atrani is usually
attributed to the art of the Saracens, whom King
Manfred called in to garrison this place during his
wars with Pope Innocent IV. Atrani, which is but
a suburb of Amalfi, suffered equally with the Capital
during the great upheaval of Nature that desolated
this coast in the fourteenth century, so that little of
interest remains except the quaint church of San
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Salvatore a Bireta, wherein the Doges of Amalfi were
once elected and crowned. This ancient building
lies hidden in a sandy cove beneath the roadway, and
those who care to run the gauntlet of beggars and
descend to the beach below, can examine its beautiful
bronze doors, which the generous citizen Pantaleone
gave <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro mercede animae suae et merito S. Sebastiani
Martyris</span></span>. But there is very little else to inspect, for
the interior has been hopelessly modernized.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Soon after passing Atrani we turn sharply up hill
to the left, and begin our ascent towards Ravello.
The dusty white road winds upwards through a
region of carefully cultivated terraces filled with olives
and vines, intermingled here and there with orange,
lemon, fig, and pomegranate trees. As we gain
higher ground, our horizon tends ever to widen, and
we behold the expanse of sea and sky melting in the
far distance into <span class="tei tei-q">“some shade of blue unnameable,”</span>
whilst the mountain-fringed ring of the Bay of Salerno
becomes vividly mapped out to our eyes from the
Cape of Minerva to the Punta di Licosia. On our
left we peer down into the depths of the dark ravine
of the Dragone, whose black shadows are popularly
supposed to give its name of Atrani to the cheerful
little town we have left behind. Let us thank Heaven
that we are at last out of reach of the beggars, and
that the only human beings to be encountered upon
the road are a few peasants with loads of fruit or
vegetables, and an occasional charcoal-burner bearing
his grimy burden to the town below. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">carbonaio</span></span>
with his blackened face and queer outlandish garments
is a familiar figure throughout all parts of Southern
Italy. He belongs to a race apart, that dwells in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the belt of forest land clothing the higher hills, and
he only descends to the cities of the shore and the
plain in order to sell his goods. He is despised by
the sharper-witted townsman, who beats down his
prices for the combustibles he has borne with such
fatigue from his distant mountain home. Sometimes
the old people are despatched to do the money
bargaining, the selling and buying. Look at the old
couple at this moment passing us; an aged man and
woman that Theocritus might have known in earlier
days when the world was less civilized and less greedy
of gain. With bare travel-stained feet, with feeble
frames supported by long staves and with the heavy
sacks of charcoal on their bent backs, the modern
Baucis and Philemon crawl along the white road
beneath a broiling sun, patient and uncomplaining,
and apparently with no feelings of envy as they cast
one careless glance at our carriage. Weary and foot-sore,
they will only obtain a few <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quattrini</span></span> in the
town for all their toil and trouble, and then they must
retrace every step up the long hill-side, with their
little stock of provisions to help eke out a miserable
existence. Yet can any life in such a climate and
amid such surroundings be truly accounted miserable,
we ask, no matter how humble the dwelling or frugal
the fare?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As our carriage creeps slowly upward, we find the
land less cultivated, and now and again we pass tracts
of woodland whence little purling streams fall over
rocky ledges on to the roadway. We catch sight of
small clumps of cyclamen, and in the shady hollows
we detect tufts of the maiden-hair fern—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Capilli di
Venere</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“Venus’ tresses,”</span> as the Italians sometimes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>call this graceful little plant. At a curve of the road
we are confronted by a smiling old peasant with gold
rings in his ears, who in the expectation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">forestieri</span></span>
coming this way has been patiently sitting for hours
on a boulder. Doffing his battered hat and putting
a sunburnt hand to his mouth, the old fellow in a deep
musical bass wakens all the sleeping echoes that lie in
the many folds of the valley, so that we hear the words
of welcome repeated again and again, growing fainter
and fainter as the sound of the voice travels from
cliff to cliff. The performer is delighted with a few
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">soldi</span></span>, and the jaded scarecrow of a horse seems pleased
with his momentary halt. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iterum altiora petimus</span></span>; by
degrees we reach the airy platform upon which Ravello
stands, and finally alight at the comfortable old inn so
long associated with the excellent family of Palumbo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ravello undoubtedly owes its early foundation to
certain patrician families of Amalfi, which after securing
their fortunes decided to leave the hot close city beside
the shore, and to seek new homes in the bracing air
of the hill-top above. Placing itself under the protection
of the powerful Robert Guiscard, Ravello became
faithfully attached to the Norman interest, and in 1086,
at the suggestion of the great Count Roger, who
cherished a deep regard for the Rufolo family, the
town was created a bishopric by Pope Victor III. As
a subject city of the Norman princes, Ravello was
during this period at the zenith of its fame and
importance. Its actual population is unknown at this
distant day, but we learn that under Count Roger the
large area of the city was entirely girdled by strong
walls set with towers; that it contained thirteen
churches, four monasteries, many public buildings, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a large number of private palaces. Its cathedral was
founded in honour of Saint Pantaleone by Niccolò
Rufolo, Duke of Sora and Grand Admiral of Sicily,
the head of the powerful family whose name is still
gratefully remembered in this half-deserted town. In
1156 Ravello was honoured by a state visit from Pope
Adrian IV.—the English monk, Nicholas Breakspear,
the only Briton who ever succeeded in gaining the
papal tiara and who gave the lordship of Ireland to
Henry Plantagenet—and during his stay the Pontiff
was entertained as the guest of the all-powerful Rufoli.
Born of humble parents in the village of Bensington,
near Oxford, Nicholas Breakspear became a monk at
St Alban’s, and having once entered the religious life,
he rose by sheer force of intellect and an iron strength
of will to the attainment of the highest honour the
Church could bestow. It was in the hey-day of his
power that the English pope entered Ravello and sang
Mass in the Cathedral in the presence of all the noble
citizens of the place, for in the previous year he had
crushed for ever the dangerous heresy of Arnold of
Brescia, by boldly sentencing that ardent reformer to
be burnt at the stake in Rome and his ashes cast into
the Tiber. The Pontiff during his visit sojourned in
the Palazzo Rufolo, the beautiful Saracenic building
that is still standing intact after so many centuries,
and by a curious coincidence is now the property of
the well-known English family of Reid. Nor was Pope
Adrian the only sovereign who honoured Ravello by his
presence, for Charles of Anjou, brother of St Louis of
France and the murderer of poor Conradin, and King
Robert the Wise also received the hospitality of the
Rufolo family within these walls. The whole existing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>town in fact is eloquent of the long extinct but by no
means forgotten Rufoli, who may fairly be reckoned
among the more enlightened of the petty tyrants of
medieval Italy. That their name was still familiar in
Italian society in the fourteenth century is evident
from the circumstances that Boccaccio puts a story,
no doubt founded on fact, into the mouth of the fair
Lauretta, which deals with the adventures of one
Landolfo Rufolo of Ravello, <span class="tei tei-q">“who, not content with
his great store, but anxious to make it double, was
near losing all he had, and his life also.”</span> The novel
proceeds to relate how this member of a wealthy and
respected family turned corsair, after losing all his
capital in a mercantile speculation in Cyprus; how he,
in his turn, was robbed of his ill-gotten gains on the
high seas by some thievish merchants of Genoa; and
how Landolfo, after passing through a variety of more
or less improbable adventures, was finally rescued from
drowning off the coast of Corfu by a servant-maid who,
whilst washing dishes by the sea-shore, chanced to
espy the unconscious merchant drifting towards the
beach with his arms clasped round a small wooden
chest, which kept him afloat. <span class="tei tei-q">“Moved by compassion,”</span>
says the relator of the tale, <span class="tei tei-q">“she stepped a little way
into the sea, which was now calm, and seizing the half-drowned
wretch by the hair of his head, drew both him
and the chest to land, where with much trouble she
unfolded his arms from the chest, which she set upon
the head of her daughter who was with her. She
herself carried Landolfo like a little child to the town,
put him on a stove, and chafed and washed him with
warm water, by which means the vital heat began to
return, and his strength partially revived. In due
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>time she took him from the stove, comforted him with
wine and good cordials, and kept him some days till
he knew where he was; she then restored him his
chest, and told him he might now provide for his
departure.”</span><a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> Of course the little chest that Landolfo
had clutched by chance in his agony of drowning
eventually turned out to be filled with precious stones,
which by a miracle—and miracles were common
enough in the days of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Decameron</span></span>—not only floated
of itself but also supported the weight of Master
Landolfo. In any case, the rescued merchant, with
the greed and ingratitude which are often accounted
for sharpness and wit, presented his kind hostess with
the empty trunk, whilst he concealed the gems in a
belt upon his own person. Equipped with these
jewels, he made his way across the Adriatic to the
Apulian coast, and thence reached Ravello with
greater wealth than he had ever hoped to obtain with
his original capital at the time he set sail for Cyprus.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fortunately Ravello, though shrunk to such modest
proportions nowadays, still possesses many memorials
of its glorious past. Travellers will of course turn
their steps towards the Duomo, with its yellow
baroque façade abutting on the little piazza that,
with its daisy-starred turf and old acacia trees, forms
so pleasant a play-ground for the merry dark-eyed
children of the place. The cathedral of St Pantaleone
is—or rather was—one of the most interesting and
richly decorated churches erected in Southern Italy
under the combined influence of Norman and Saracenic
art at a time when cunning workmen were able to
blend together the styles of East and West, and to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>produce that rich harmonious architecture of which
the splendid churches of Monreale and Palermo
present to us the happiest examples. There still
exist intact the magnificent bronze doors with their
fifty-four panels of sculpture in relief, the gift of
Sergio Muscettola and his wife, Sigilgaita Rufolo,
and the work of the Italian artist Barisanus of Trani,
who likewise designed and cast the portals of the
cathedrals of his native town and of Monreale. But
alas! the interior of the building, that was once
rich with <a name="corr159" id="corr159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">mosaic</span> and fresco and fanciful carving, has
been converted into one of those dull soulless caverns
of stucco that the wanderer in all parts of Italy meets
with only too frequently. This deplorable act of
vandalism at Ravello dates of course from the
eighteenth century, and appears to have been the
work of a bishop named Tafuri, who in his frenzied
eagerness to possess a cathedral worthy of comparison
with the fashionable atrocities in plaster then being
erected at Naples, did not hesitate to destroy wholesale
almost all the ancient and elaborate ornamentation
of his Duomo. His architect—perhaps the
miserable Fuga, who ruined the interior of the
Cathedral at Palermo, who knows?—dug up the fine
old pavement, tore out the mosaics and had them
carted away, effaced the frescoes, and at last transformed
the venerable building with its memories of
popes and princes into a commonplace white-washed
chamber. Why this wretched prelate stayed his
hand at the pulpit, it is difficult to say: perhaps he
was meanwhile translated for his private virtues,
perhaps Death overtook him in the work of destruction;
at any rate, the famous pulpit of Ravello
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mercifully escaped the general onslaught, though it
must have been by fortunate accident and not by
design that Monsignore Tafuri omitted to remove
this unique specimen of a style of architecture, which
doubtless he considered barbaric and un-Christian in
its character. For this pulpit is one of the finest
examples of the ornate, if somewhat bizarre art of
the thirteenth century, and belongs to a type of work
that is not unfrequently met with throughout Italy.
Six spiral columns, springing from the backs of
crouched lions, support the rostrum of marble inlaid
with beautiful mosaics; whilst above the arch of the
stair-way of ascent stands the famous portrait, usually
called that of Sigilgaita Rufolo, wife of the founder
of the Cathedral. The striking face, which is surmounted
by an elaborate diadem with two pendent
lappets, is evidently an excellent likeness of the
original; yet there can be no doubt that this interesting
bust has been wrongly named, since the
pulpit itself, as a Latin inscription duly records, was
erected in the year 1272 by Niccolò Rufolo, a
descendant of the famous Grand Admiral, so that we
may fairly conclude that the portrait represents the
wife, or perhaps sister or daughter, of the donor.
But popular tradition dies hard; and the name of
Sigilgaita will probably cling for ever to the female
face which has for over six centuries looked calmly
down upon generation after generation of worshippers.
Perhaps those severe proud features may have
impressed the ignorant Vandal-Bishop as that of
some unknown Saint, whom it might be dangerous
to offend, and may thereby have saved the pulpit
of Niccolò Rufolo from the destruction that must
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>have seemed inevitable. Be that as it may, the bust
has survived uninjured, which, apart from the feeling
of sentiment, is particularly fortunate, for it belongs
to a small class of artistic work, of which existing
specimens are rare and highly prized. For there
must have been a local and premature Renaissance
in this part of Italy during the thirteenth century,
otherwise a statue so imbued with true classical
feeling and so correct in technical finish as that of
Sigilgaita in Ravello Cathedral could never have
been produced; yet the names of the artist or artists
who thus anticipated the great plastic revival remain
undiscovered. Portrait-busts, similar in treatment
and idea to that of the so-called Sigilgaita, are to be
found here and there in museums, but this effigy in
remote Ravello remains unique amidst its original
surroundings.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Turning aside from Sigilgaita’s steady gaze and
making the round of the bleak white-washed building,
our eyes are suddenly attracted by a fine picture,
in the manner of Domenichino, representing the
martyrdom of Pantaleone, the popular Amalfitan
Saint to whom this church was dedicated by the
Rufolo family.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The cult of this Asiatic martyr in Amalfi is of
course another legacy of the Republic’s close connection
with the Levant, whence some relic-hunting
admiral or merchant of the state reverently brought
Pantaleone’s bones to the Italian coast. As the
veneration of this Saint still exists so deep-seated
that his Hellenic name is frequently bestowed on
children at baptism, it may not be deemed amiss to
give a very brief account of this eastern Martyr, who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>is so closely associated with Amalfitan, and later with
Venetian life. Pantaleone was born at Nicomedia,
in Bithynia, the son of a Pagan father and a Christian
mother. Well educated by his parents, he became
a physician, and on account of his skill, his learning,
his graceful manners and his handsome face, was
finally selected to attend the person of the Emperor
Maximian. At the Imperial Court the young doctor,
who had meantime neglected the faith of his mother,
was recalled to a true sense of Christian duty
by the precepts of an old priest named Hermolaus.
Pantaleone now began to heal the sick and to preach
the Gospel, and even at times to perform miracles.
Information as to his conduct having reached the
Emperor’s ears, Maximian gave the young physician
the choice of renouncing Christianity or of suffering
death, whereat Pantaleone boldly declared he would
rather die than apostatize. Thereupon the Saint,
together with the Christian priest Hermolaus, was
bound to an olive tree and beheaded with a sword.
The story of his martyrdom has been frequently treated
in Venetian art, for as an eastern Saint Pantaleone
has a church dedicated to him in Venice, wherein the
brush of Paul Veronese has painted in glowing colours
the chief incidents of his life and death. As in the
case of other physician-saints of the Roman Church—St
Roch, St Cosmo and St Damiano—Pantaleone
was especially besought in cases of the plague, which
owing to the intercommunication between Amalfi
and the Orient, frequently ravaged the towns of this
coast.

From the Cathedral we proceeded to visit the quaint
little church of Santa Maria del Gradillo, that with its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>oriental-looking towers and cupolas affords a pleasing
example of the mixed Lombard and Saracenic style
which was in vogue in the years when the house of
Hohenstaufen were masters of Southern Italy. We
found little that was worth seeing inside the building,
except the pretty black-eyed daughter of the
toothless tottering old sacristan, who slunk off grumbling
on his child’s appearance, leaving her to do the
honours of the place. Her merry face with its welcoming
smile and her modest loquacity excited our
interest, and in answer to our questions we gathered
that she was twenty years old, and was still unmarried,
not for lack of opportunity, she naïvely told us, but
because she was unwilling to leave her old parents,
who had no one in the world but herself to attend to
them. Coming to the door of the church, Angela
(for that was her name) pointed out her home, a
little white-washed cottage with a heavily barred
window over-hanging the grass-grown lane. We
wished our pleasant companion a warm good-bye,
or rather <a name="sic163" id="sic163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a riverderla</span></span>, at the entrance of the dwelling,
where through the open doorway we could espy a
small sun-smitten courtyard tenanted by a wizened
old woman sitting in the shade of an orange tree, by
three cats, and by a large family of skinny hens. On
a low wall we noted some shallow earthenware pans
filled with carnation plants, whose red and yellow
heads were clearly silhouetted against the blue sky
over head. Perhaps Angela’s life, we thought, is after
all happier thus spent in the tending of her parents,
her poultry and her garden, than if joined to that of
some swarthy rascal of the beach below or dull
peasant of the hillside. Long may the old people
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>survive to keep their guardian Angel from the mingled
sorrows and joys of matrimony!

The well-known hotel kept by Madame Palumbo,
who is thoroughly conversant with English ways and
requirements, occupies a delightful position in the old
aristocratic quarter of Ravello known as <span class="tei tei-q">“Il Toro,”</span>
the name of which is still retained in the interesting
little church of San Giovanni del Toro close by.
This comfortable hostelry has been constructed out of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vescovado</span></span>, the ancient episcopal residence, and it
still retains many curious and attractive features of
the original building, notably the quaint little stair-way
that descends from the bishop’s private chamber
into the chapel, which is now the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">salon</span></span> of the hotel.
With its magnificent views, its interesting buildings
and its pure exhilarating air, Ravello would seem to
be an ideal spot wherein to linger, and it affords
a most agreeable change in the later Spring months
from the close atmosphere and enervating heat of
Amalfi or the coast towns. Perched on this breezy
hill-top, from the terrace of the hotel can be observed
the whole circuit of the Bay of Salerno, whilst behind
to the north and east the ring of enclosing mountains
rises sharp and distinct against the sky. From this
point we are presented with a complete view of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the territories of the ancient Republic, spread out like
a map beneath our feet and stretching from the Punta
della Campanella to the heights above Vietri, and backed
by the arid grey mountain peaks. If the garden
of the Hotel Palumbo seems a fitting place wherein to
idle or to dream, might not it also appeal to some
historian, not tied to time nor to the hard necessity of
money-making, as a suitable spot for the conception
of a history of the origin, rise, decline and fall of
the great maritime Republic, whose dominions, still
smiling and populous, surround Ravello on all sides?
Gibbon found the first suggestion for his Roman
History whilst musing upon the ruins of the Capitol,
and he finished his great work in a Swiss garden
amidst the scent of acacia bloom; might not the
annals of the Amalfitan Republic likewise spring from
reflections made upon this terrace, where the memories
of a former greatness still beautiful in its decay must
operate so powerfully? Well, perhaps some future
Gibbon—or more probably some budding Mommsen—may
in time present the world with a true impartial
and erudite history of the Costiera d’Amalfi.

We bask lazily in the afternoon sunshine, to the
soft, rather soporific cooing of some caged doves, that

Below the vinery we catch glimpses of the dancing

trees that are gently swayed by the south wind.
Opposite to us towers the huge form of the mountain
of the Avvocata, upon whose slopes centuries ago the
Madonna herself appeared in a flood of glory to
an ignorant but pious shepherd lad, promising the
startled youth to become his mediator, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">avvocata</span></span> of
his simple prayers. The story must be true, say the
peasants, for there on the hillside can still be seen the
ruins of the shrine that the wondering and grateful
villagers raised upon the very site of the apparition in
honour of their celestial visitor. But the whole
country-side teems with interesting and often beautiful
legends and traditions, handed down by generations of
the simple hardy folk who toil for their daily bread
amidst the vineyards and olive groves that clothe the
sun-baked slopes descending to the shore.

The intervening distance is not great between
Ravello and La Scala, which surmounts the opposite
ridge of the valley of the Dragone, whence good
walkers can easily descend by the ancient mule
track that leads down direct to Amalfi by way of
Scaletta. Like its neighbour and historic rival across
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the valley, the annals and fortunes of Scala are closely
interwoven with those of Amalfi; and it was during
the palmy days of the Republic that this daughter-town
reached its height of prosperity. Although the
tradition that once Scala possessed a hundred towers
upon its walls and a hundred and thirty churches is
obviously exaggerated, yet it must have been a place
of importance even as early as 987, when Pope John
XVI raised it to the rank of a bishopric, an honour
which did not fall to Ravello until many years later.
Early in the twelfth century Scala was pillaged by the
Pisans, but some years afterwards, when the mother
city tamely submitted to the demands of these Tuscan
invaders without the smallest effort at self-defence, the
higher-spirited mountaineers of La Scala manned their
walls with skill and vigour, though without avail.
The hill-set city was ultimately carried by storm, and
so thoroughly did the enraged Pisans wreak their
vengeance upon the place that Scala never again rose
to fame or eminence, but henceforward dwindled in
wealth and size until it finally sank to the condition of
a large village, whilst Clement VIII offered an
additional indignity to the city in its dotage by depriving
it of episcopal rank. But though the citizens of
modern Scala no longer possess a bishop in their
midst, they are still the proud possessors and jealous
guardians of the magnificent mitre presented by Charles
of Anjou, who was greatly pleased by the men and
money that this ancient town sent to aid his brother,
St Louis of France, in his Crusade. Some sculptured
tombs, one of them a monument in honour of Marinella
Rufolo of Ravello, who was married to a Coppola of
Scala, remain in the churches to interest the curious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>traveller, but most visitors will find the principal charm
of this dilapidated little city in its lofty striking situation
beneath the frowning mass of Monte Cerrato.

But the sunset has come and gone, and the last
tints of its rose-pink glow are rapidly disappearing from
the serrated line of mountain tops against their background
of daffodil sky. Stars are beginning to peep
in the firmament, and yellow lights, the stars of earth,
are springing up fast in the town below, and even
appearing at rare intervals of space amongst the
cottages of the woody hillside, or upon the fishing
boats that lie on the bosom of the Bay, now turning
to a deep purple under the advancing shadows of
night. A cheerful concert of unseen insects greets
our ears as we descend rapidly towards Atrani, whilst
the goatbells amid the distant pastures tinkle pleasantly
from time to time. We soon exchange the dewy
freshness of evening in the country for the heavy air,
thick with dust, that hangs over the coast road, and
in a few moments more find ourselves at the foot of
the rock-cut staircase that leads to our convent inn.

But our days upon the beautiful Costiera d’Amalfi
are at an end, and the moment has at last come
for us to bid farewell to these enchanted scenes and to
the ancient city slumbering peacefully in its rocky
valley by the shore. Our rows upon the glassy waters
of the Bay, our scrambles up the wild scrub-covered
hillsides above the town, our evening walks along the
broad high-road to catch the fleeting glories of the
sun-set,—all are ended; the day, the hour of departure
has actually arrived.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Casting a longing look behind we quit Amalfi in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the cool of the evening, in order to cover the eight
intervening miles of coast road that lie between us and
Salerno. We pass Atrani, with its tall parti-coloured
tower, and proceed towards our destination with the
smooth plain of waters below us and the fertile slopes
above our heads, and thus we quickly gain Minori,
another of the busy little settlements that once helped
to make up the collected might of the old Republic.
We meet with bare-footed sun-embrowned peasants,
in their suits of blue linen and broad shady straw
hats; lean sinewy figures, returning from a long day’s
work in the fragrant orange groves by which the town
is surrounded. We meet also, alas! with the usual
crowd of beggars, the halt, the maimed, and the
pseudo-blind, who are quickly left behind; nevertheless
the naughty picturesque half-naked children,
loudly screaming for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">soldi</span></span>, caper in the dust alongside
our carriage, until these little pests are out-stripped,
but only to give way to other imps, equally
naughty and unclothed, from Majori. Majori, nestling
by the seashore amidst the enfolding mountains, appears
to us a second Amalfi, with its crowded beach and
brightly coloured boats, with its paper and maccaroni
mills, huddled into the narrow ravine of the Senna,
which cuts the town in half ere it empties itself into
the Bay. Overhead the huge ruined castle of San
Niccolò looms distinct against the rose-flushed evening
sky, crouching like some decrepit old giant above the
little city which he so oppressed in the bad old days
when Sanseverini and Colonna carried on a perpetual
selfish strife that allowed their humble neighbours no
repose. Beautiful as is Majori, it is no lovelier than
many another spot upon this exquisite coast; it is but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as one pearl in a well-matched necklace, for the country
that lies between Amalfi and Salerno is fully as rich
in historical interest and natural charm as is the
western portion that we have just traversed. Behind
Majori we behold Monte Falerio, with its rocky
summit tipped with the glow of evening and its base
in purple shadow, descending abruptly into the darkening
waters of the Bay. Slanting down to the surf-fringed
beach, the great mountain seem to bar our
further progress, but with a guttural imprecation and
a loud cracking of the whip, our coachman deftly
guides his half-starved but cunning little horses round
the sharp corner of the mountain spur known as the
Capo del’ Orso, and in a trice Amalfi, whither we have
been straining our eyes, is snatched from our vision;
a few minutes later, and we have rounded the Capo
del Tumulo, with its memories of the great Genoese
admiral, Filippino Doria, who in the treacherous
currents that circle round this Cape, destroyed the
Spanish fleet of the Emperor Charles V. Already the
sun has dipped below the horizon, and the calm
expanse of the Tyrrhene has lost the last reflected ray;
forward our driver urges his horses in the fast-fading
light. The Angelus rings out from half a score of
belfries beside the seashore and on the hillside,
breaking the stillness of the gloaming with musical
reverberations. Sunset and evening star, twilight and
evening bell; how exquisite is the fall of night upon
the shores of the Bay of Salerno! We pass the fishing
village of Cetara, and in so doing we pass by the
willing strength of imagination out of the dominion of
the ancient Republic of Amalfi into the Principality
of Salerno. Onward we press, and it is not long
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>before a shrill familiar sound bursts upon our ears,
a sound that quickly tears the gossamer threads of a
fancy revelling in the thoughts of long-extinct principalities
and powers. It is the whistle of a railway-engine
descending the slope from Vietri above us
down to Salerno; it is the neighing of the iron horse
that has not yet pranced along the unconquered
Costiera d’Amalfi, nor befouled its crystal-clear air
with his smoky breath. For at Vietri we re-enter the
every-day world, and leave behind us the sea-girt fairy-land;
Vietri, not Cetara, is the true frontier town to-day.
But the lights of Salerno are drawing nearer
and nearer, and in a few moments of time we are
tearing along the broad lamp-lit Marina of the town,
in the middle of which our driver pulls up suddenly
at the entrance of that old-fashioned comfortable inn,
the Albergo d’Inghilterra:

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Backed by gentle slopes well wooded and well
tilled, and screened from the northern blasts
by its guarding amphitheatre of grey crags, Salerno
occupies a delightful position upon the Bay to which
it gives its own name. The long stretch of its Marina,
tolerably clean to the eye if not at all points agreeable
to the nostrils, follows the broad curve of the strand,
and an idle hour or so may pleasantly be whiled away
in watching the fishing craft moored beside the mole
and the attendant sailors. At the northern end of
this promenade, in what constitutes the most fashionable
quarter of the place, is a tiny garden with palms
and daturas, whilst hard by stands a large theatre,
evidences of the gentility of modern Salerno. But
the whole town appears sleepy and dead-alive to a
stranger, though at the sunset hour a band occasionally
plays in this open space, the music attracting hither a
crowd composed of all the divers elements of society
in the quiet old city. Yet though not possessing any
great attractions for a sojourn in itself, Salerno makes
an excellent centre whence to explore the neighbourhood,
for it lies within easy reach of the great
Benedictine Abbey of Santa Trinità; of beautiful La
Cava, <span class="tei tei-q">“that Alpine valley under an Italian sky”</span>; of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Nocera, with its ancient cathedral that was once a
pagan temple; and last, but very far from least, of
that glorious group of temples at Paestum. It has
tolerable hotels, and if only their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">padroni</span></span> could be
brought to realise that a flavouring of rosemary and
garlic in every dish is not appreciated by the palates
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">forestieri</span></span>, the fare provided would be excellent.
As in all Italian cities, northern or southern, however,
the nocturnal noise is prodigious. Shouting and
shrieking, quarrelling and yelling rend the air at all
hours, whilst the practice of serenading, more agreeable
in romantic poetry than in everyday life, is here
carried to excess, and the twanging of the mandoline
and the throaty voices of ardent lovers are rarely silent
o’ nights in the dark narrow streets of Salerno.

Behind the long line of lofty well-built houses facing
the Bay, the streets are gloomy, narrow and crooked,
a labyrinth of dark mysterious lanes that contain no
palaces or churches of note, and but few artistic <span class="tei tei-q">“bits”</span>
to catch the eye and delight the soul of a painter. As
in the case of Amalfi, the Cathedral of San Matteo at
Salerno is almost the sole monument left standing of a
past that is peculiarly rich in historical associations.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Ever since the accession of the Angevin kings Salerno
has remained a quiet provincial town, neither rich nor
poor, but stagnant and without commerce. Into its
harbour, which Norman and Suabian princes attempted
to improve, the sand has long since silted, and Naples
for many centuries past has been able to regard with
serene contempt the city that it was once intended to
make her commercial rival:

Well, Naples owns an excellent harbour, and has
in consequence grown into one of the largest sea-ports
on the shores of the Mediterranean, whilst little Salerno
can only afford anchorage for fishing boats.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The chief interest of the place centres in its close
connection with the great Norman house of Hauteville,
and especially with Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia
and Calabria, who after a fierce struggle managed to
capture this city from the Lombard princes. Sprung
from a hardy race of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">valvassors</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bannerets</span></span> in Normandy,
Duke Robert was one of the twelve sons of
Tancred of Hauteville in the bishopric of Coutances.
Joining his elder half-brother William Bras-de-Fer in
Italy, Robert at once began to make a remarkable
display of soldierly and statesman-like qualities. An
adventurer pure and simple in an alien land, this
sharp-witted Norman in course of time obtained the
nick-name of Guiscard, or the Wiseacre, and on the
death of his elder brother he was nominated Count of
Apulia by acclamation of the Norman followers, to the
exclusion of his helpless young nephews. Robert
Guiscard’s appearance and character have been sketched
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for us with loving care by one of the most famous of
the world’s historians, who was fully able to appreciate
the mingled force and cunning, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">suaviter in modo</span></span>
and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fortiter in re</span></span>, of this leader of a handful
of Normans in a hostile and distant country. Let
Gibbon’s stately prose therefore present to us a
word-painting of the Great Adventurer himself:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“His lofty stature surpassed the tallest of his army;
his limbs were cast in the true proportion of strength
and gracefulness; and to the decline of life he maintained
the patent vigour of health and the commanding
dignity of his form. His complexion was ruddy,
his shoulders were broad, his hair and beard were long
and of a flaxen colour, his eyes sparkled with fire, and
his voice, like that of Achilles, could impress obedience
and terror amidst the tumult of battle. In the ruder
ages of chivalry, such qualifications are not below the
notice of the poet or historian; they may observe that
Robert at once and with equal dexterity could wield
in the right hand his sword, his lance in the left; that
in the battle of Civitella he was thrice unhorsed, and
that on the close of that memorable day he was adjudged
to have borne away the prize of valour from
the warriors of the two armies. His boundless ambition
was founded on the consciousness of superior
worth: in the pursuit of greatness he was never
arrested by the scruples of justice, and seldom moved
by the feelings of humanity: though not insensible of
fame, the choice of open or clandestine means was
determined only by his present advantage. The
surname of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Guiscard</span></span> was applied to this master of
political wisdom, which is too often confounded with
the practice of dissimulation and deceit; and Robert
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>is praised by the Apulian poet for excelling the
cunning of Ulysses and the eloquence of Cicero. Yet
these arts were disguised by an appearance of military
frankness: in his highest fortune he was accessible and
courteous to his fellow soldiers, and while he indulged
the prejudices of his new subjects, he affected in his
dress and manners to maintain the ancient fashion
of his country. He grasped with a rapacious, that he
might distribute with a liberal hand; his primitive
indigence had taught the habits of frugality; the gain
of a merchant was not below his attention; and his
prisoners were tortured with slow and unfeeling cruelty
to force a discovery of their secret treasure. According
to the Greeks, he departed from Normandy with only
five followers on horse-back, and thirty on foot; yet
even this allowance appears too bountiful;—the sixth
son of Tancred of Hauteville passed the Alps as a
pilgrim, and his first military band was levied among
the adventurers of Italy.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Gaining over the Pope Nicholas II. to his interests,
the new Count was able to exact an oath of fealty in
1060 from the Italian barons, hitherto his equals, to
recognise him as <span class="tei tei-q">“Duke of Apulia, Calabria, and here-after
of Sicily, by the grace of God and of St Peter,”</span>
although it took many years of hard fighting before
these lands, thus proudly claimed, could be subdued.
Beginning with the conquest of the Duchy of Benevento,
Guiscard at once laid siege to Salerno, taking it
after an obstinate resistance lasting over eight months,
during which he was himself severely wounded by a
splinter from one of his own engines of war. The
city captured with such difficulty now became the
victor’s favourite residence and the recipient of his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>bounty and enlightened rule, so that Salerno quickly
rose to the rank of one of the most illustrious towns
in Europe, supplanting even its magnificent neighbour
Amalfi in popular esteem.

It was under the Guiscard’s auspices that the
famous school of Medicine that had long been seated
at Salerno rose to its highest point of excellence.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Paris for learning, Bologna for law, Orleans for
poetry, and Salerno for Medicine”</span>;—such was the
verdict of the age. With the somewhat grudging
consent of the clergy, the hygienic skill of the dreaded
Arabs was in this city permitted to temper the crass
ignorance of medieval Italy, and at Salerno alone
were the works of the infidel Avicenna and of the
pagans Galen and Hippocrates openly studied. The
result was that the fame of the doctors of this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fons
Medicinae</span></span> spread over all Western Europe, so that
distinguished patients either came hither to be treated
in person or else sent emissaries to explain their
symptoms and to obtain advice. Nor were the
professors of the healing art at Salerno tied down by
a strict adherence to drugs and boluses, for they fully
realised that the height of all human ambition, the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mens sana in corpore sano</span></span>, is in any case more easily
to be obtained by self-control than by all the
in<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gredients of the pharmacopoeia. They were warm
believers apparently in the doctrine of moderation in
all things, which after all is one of the most valuable
prescriptions of modern hygiene:

Such was the oracular reply of the Salernitan

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But to return to Robert Guiscard, who shares the
historical honours of the place, together with the great
Pope Gregory VII., of whom we shall speak presently.
After subduing the southern half of Italy and the
island of Sicily, the great Duke next turned his
victorious arms against the Eastern Empire, with the
secret intention, it was suspected, of ascending the
throne of Constantine. With the pseudo-Emperor
Michael in his train, the Great Adventurer in 1081
assembled a vast army at Otranto, consisting of
30,000 Italian subjects and of 1300 Norman knights,
with the object of crossing over to Epirus. Durazzo
on the opposite Albanian coast, the Dyrrachium of
the ancients, a city that was henceforth destined to be
closely associated with succeeding dynasties of South
Italy, was the objective of this gigantic expedition,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for it was commonly reported to be the key of the
Eastern Empire. Thither the flotilla set sail, but
before reaching the Greek shore, an unexpected and
unseasonable tempest scattered Guiscard’s argosy,
destroying many of the ships and drowning many
crews. Nevertheless, the undaunted spirit and endless
resources of the Norman Duke rose superior to all
misfortunes. Landing with the remnant of his army
he at once laid siege to Durazzo, despite the fact that
the Emperor Alexius was marching to its relief, and
that the Venetian fleet was already anchored in its
harbour. In spite of overwhelming odds, Guiscard
utterly routed the Byzantine army. With his heir
Bohemond and his wife Sigilgaita beside him, the
Duke watched the progress of the battle, and at its
most critical juncture, at a moment when it appeared
inevitable that the hard-pressed Italian army must
yield to the sheer numbers of the foe, the deep voice
of the leader could be heard booming like a deep-toned
bell over the battlefield, as he addressed his wavering
troops. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whither do ye fly? Your enemy is implacable,
and death is less grievous than slavery!”</span>
Joined with the hoarse voice of Guiscard, the Norman
warriors could distinguish the exhortations of the
Amazon-like Sigilgaita, <span class="tei tei-q">“a second Pallas, less skilful
in arts, but no less terrible in arms than the Athenian
goddess.”</span> Rallying at the words of their master and
shamed by the martial ardour of the Duchess, the invading
troops made one last desperate effort, whereby
the Imperial army was driven back and scattered, so
that Alexius barely escaped with his life. Having
routed the Emperor in fair fight, Guiscard now made
use of his unparalleled cunning by bribing the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>treacherous Venetians, who eventually assisted the
Italian forces to enter the city gates, and thus Durazzo
was gained at the point of the sword after one of the
fiercest sieges known to history. Scarcely had the
beleaguered town been reduced, than the indomitable
Guiscard found himself compelled to return to Italy,
where the Emperor of the West, the unhappy Henry
IV., vainly endeavouring to wipe out the humiliation
of Canossa, had seized Rome and was actually besieging
the great Hildebrand in the Castle of Sant’ Angelo.
Leaving his son Bohemond in command of the army
in Macedonia, Robert recrossed the sea, and hastened
with a handful of men towards Rome. But so intense
a fear did the victor of Durazzo inspire, that the
terrified Emperor without waiting to give combat fled
headlong together with his anti-pope from the Holy
City, where Guiscard was received with acclamation.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Thus, in less than three years,”</span> remarks Gibbon, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
son of Tancred of Hauteville enjoyed the glory of
delivering the Pope, and of compelling the two
Emperors of the East and West to fly before his
victorious arms.”</span> Guiscard’s triumphal entry into
Rome was however marred by scenes of violence and
scandal, due to the conduct of the Saracen troops which
his brother, the great Count Roger of Sicily, had
brought to assist the enterprise. So infuriated were
the Romans by the behaviour of the infidels, that the
prudent Gregory deemed it wiser to return to Salerno
together with his deliverer, and it was in Guiscard’s
palace that the famous <span class="tei tei-q">“Caesar of spiritual conquest”</span>
expired three years later. As to the Great
Adventurer himself, he died in the island of Cephalonia
in the very year of the Pope’s death at Salerno (1085)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and was buried beside his first wife, the gentle Alberada,
at Venosa in Apulia, though the city which he had
always loved and favoured would seem to have offered
a more appropriate spot for his interment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But although the mortal remains of the Great
Adventurer do not rest within the precincts of his
beloved city, an undying monument of his glorious
but turbulent reign is to be found in the Cathedral,
which despite the neglect and alterations of eight
centuries may still be ranked as one of the most
interesting buildings in Southern Italy. Standing in a
secluded part of the town, this magnificent church
gains nothing from its position, for it can only be
reached by means of tortuous dingy lanes, and even
on a near approach the effect produced on the visitor
is not impressive. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Cathedral-church of San
Matteo,”</span> says the Scotch traveller, Joseph Forsyth, in
quaint pedantic language, <span class="tei tei-q">“is a pile so antique and so
modern, so repaired and rhapsodic, that it exhibits
patches of every style, and is of no style itself.”</span> But
is not this quality, we ask, exactly what a great
historic building, such as Guiscard’s church, truly
demands? Ought not it to bear the impress of the
various ages it has survived, and of the many famous
persons who have contributed to its embellishment?
From Duke Robert’s day to the present time, the
Cathedral is an epitome of the history of Salerno, a
sermon in stones concerning the great past and the
inglorious present of the city.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the year preceding his own death and that of
the great Pontiff, who was tarrying at Salerno as
his not over-willing guest, Duke Robert erected this
Cathedral, obtaining the chief ornaments for his new
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>structure and also its most important relic, the supposed
body of the Apostle St Matthew, from the lately
deserted city of Paestum across the bay. The church
is approached by means of a quadrangular fore-court,
a cloister supported on antique columns, such as can
still be observed in a few of the old Roman churches,
so that we venture to think that this idea at Salerno
was suggested by the great Pope himself. A number
of sculptured sarcophagi, which, like the pillars, were
the spoils of Paestum, are ranged alongside the
entrance walls; and once upon a time there stood in
the centre of the courtyard the huge granite basin
that all visitors to Naples will recall as set in the
middle of the Villa Reale, where it performs the
humble office of decorating a miniature pond, wherein
lily-white ducks quack and gobble at the bread crumbs
thrown to them by children and their nurses. Fancy
the irate disgust of Duke Robert at waking to learn
that the antique fountain for his new Cathedral, brought
with such care and toil from distant Poseidonia, should
have been transported to the rival city and turned to
such base uses! Above the splendid bronze doors, the
gift of Landolfo Butomilea and his wife shortly after
Guiscard’s death, we perceive the dedication of the
church to the Apostle Matthew by the proud conqueror
of the Two Sicilies and the protector of Hildebrand.

But it is necessary to shake off the spirit of Renaissance
dilettantism before we venture to approach the
chapel of John of Procida to the right of the high
altar, where stands the stern figure of the greatest
of the medieval Pontiffs. Above the marble statue
of the Caesar of the Papacy, that was tardily erected
to his memory by the unfortunate Pio Nono, appear
the glittering mosaics of the apse of the chapel, from
which look down the figures of John of Procida and of
King Manfred, the last sovereign prince of the hated
Suabian line that Gregory twice anathematized.
Beneath the cold forbidding eye of the last of the
Hohenstaufen and his friend and avenger here rest,
strangely enough, the ashes of that <span class="tei tei-q">“great and
inflexible asserter of the supremacy of the sacerdotal
order: the monk Hildebrand, afterwards Pope
Gregory the Seventh.”</span> Born the son of a poor
carpenter in the Tuscan village of Soana, this extraordinary
man rose to eminence as a monk of Cluny,
where he became famous for his extreme asceticism
of life in an age of undisguised clerical corruption
and luxury, when simony, lay investiture and priestly
marriages were the rule rather than the exception on
all sides, so that but few Churchmen were able to rise
above their surrounding temptations. Such few as
could resist the world, the flesh and the devil were
accounted, and not unfrequently were in reality,
ignorant crazy fanatics, half-pitied and half-despised.
Between these two extremes of worldly indulgence
and of unreasoning severity of life, Hildebrand ever
pursued a middle course, for whilst on the one hand
he eschewed the vanities of life around him, on the
other he never sank into the self-effacement of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a hermit. His acknowledged purity and zeal soon
won for him from the laity a respect mingled with awe,
whilst his natural talents, his indomitable will, and
his genuine piety in course of time brought all
Churchmen who had any regard for their holy office
to fix their hopes upon this Clugniac monk, now a
Cardinal. For some years before his actual election
to the Papal throne in 1079, Hildebrand had begun
to exercise an immense control over the councils of
the Church, and he was personally responsible for
the epoch-making resolution under Nicholas II., which
declared that the choice of a new Pontiff was vested
in the College of Cardinals alone. His own election,
under the terms of this new and drastic arrangement,
became the signal for the fierce struggles, equally
of the battlefield and the council-chamber, that were
destined to distract Italy for generations to come. For,
as might have been expected, the Emperor Henry IV.,
King of the Romans, was not long in protesting against
so decided an infringement of his secular claims.
From the synods of Worms and Piacenza came the
Imperial decree of deposition against Gregory, which
was addressed by <span class="tei tei-q">“Henry, not by usurpation but
by God’s holy ordination, King, to Hildebrand, no
longer Pope, but false monk.”</span> Gregory, strong alike
in virtue and in resolve, and aided by the might
of the Countess Matilda of Tuscany and of Robert
Guiscard, answered by pronouncing a solemn anathema
upon his secular adversary. In awe-struck silence the
Council of the Lateran listened to the Pope’s final
excommunication of the King, and of all those
who dared to associate themselves with him. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
absolve,”</span> said Gregory, <span class="tei tei-q">“all Christians from the oaths
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which they have taken or may take to him; and
I decree that no one shall obey him as king; for it
is fitting that he, who has endeavoured to diminish
the honour of the Church, should himself lose that
honour which he seems to have.”</span> We all know
the final act of that terrible unequal struggle, the
duel of brute force against spiritual terrors in a rude
age of violence and superstition, which took place
in the courtyard of the Castle of Canossa, the
Countess Matilda’s fortress in the Apennines.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“On a dreary winter morning, with the ground
deep in snow, the King, the heir of a long line
of Emperors, was permitted to enter within the
two outer of the three walls which girded the Castle
of Canossa. He had laid aside every mark of
royalty or of distinguished station; he was clad
only in the thin white linen dress of the penitent,
and there, fasting, he awaited in humble patience
the pleasure of the Pope. But the gates did not
unclose. A second day he stood, cold, hungry and
mocked by vain hopes. And yet a third day dragged
on from morning till evening over the unsheltered
head of the discrowned King. Every heart was moved
save that of the representative of Jesus Christ.”</span>

Can we wonder then that the phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“to go to
Canossa”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gehen nach Canossa</span></span>) has become ingrafted
on to the German language, or that so significant an
expression was openly used by Prince Bismarck
during the fierce religious struggles in the days of
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Kultur-kampf”</span> between the newly-formed
Empire and the direct successor of the spiritual Caesar
who had thus humbled a former Emperor of Germany?
It was in vain that Henry afterwards endeavoured,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by making war upon his oppressor, to undo the evil
effects of his public recantation at Canossa; the act
of humiliation was too marked ever to be wiped out
either by himself or by his descendants. For good
or for bad, Gregory had succeeded in rendering the
Papacy free from lay control; he had gained for ever
for the Church one of her most cherished tenets, the
absolute independence of the Pope’s election by the
College of Cardinals; and he had even partially reduced
the Western Empire into a fief of the Church
itself. The former of Gregory’s great objects, the
freedom of election, still remains intact after an interval
of more than eight hundred years; the latter
attempt, though long struggled for and apparently
with success at times, has, we know, ultimately failed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having accomplished so much during his reign,
it is strange to think that Gregory’s last days should
have been passed in a form of exile away from the
Eternal City which he claimed as the metropolis of
the Universal Church. There is pathos to be found
in the Pope dying at Salerno, far removed from the
scene of his ambition and success. With the bitter
feeling that his name was execrated in Rome after
Guiscard’s sack, and that his host was bent upon
obtaining the imperial title from his reluctant guest,
Gregory’s declining days were spent in melancholy
reflections. To the last he spoke confidently of the
righteousness of his cause, and whilst making his
peace with all mankind in anticipation of his approaching
end, he deliberately excepted from his own and
God’s mercy the names of his arch-enemy Henry and
the anti-pope Guibert, together with all their followers.
Thus the aged Pontiff languished to his end within
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the walls of the Castle of Salerno, encircled by flattering
Churchmen who did their utmost to cheer their
dying champion. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have loved justice and hated
iniquity, and therefore I die in exile,”</span> are the
famous words recorded of Hildebrand in the face of
the King of Terrors. <span class="tei tei-q">“In exile thou canst not die!”</span>
eagerly responded an attendant priest. <span class="tei tei-q">“Vicar of
Christ and His Apostles, thou hast received the
nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts
of the earth for thy possession.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Perhaps the expiring Pope was cheered by these
words—who can tell? In any case they were prophetic,
for the present world-wide character of the
Roman Church, which embraces in its fold all nationalities
and holds its members together all the globe
over in one indissoluble bond of a spiritual empire,
is largely due to the trials and exertions of one man:
the monk Hildebrand, Pope Gregory the Seventh.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here then he sleeps his last sleep, the friend of Matilda,
the mortal foe of King Henry, the patron of William
the Conqueror, the guest of Robert Guiscard:—what
a galaxy of illustrious names shines upon that dim
silent chapel in the Cathedral of Salerno! Here
stands in unchanging benediction his gleaming marble
effigy, calmly surveyed by King Manfred near at
hand in imperial robes, the last prince of the hated
and twice banned Suabian House, whose bones were
destined to bleach in the sun and rattle in the wind
by the bridge of Benevento under a Papal curse.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Before we quit the Cathedral in order to enjoy the
evening sunshine, which is filling the interior with
its roseate glow, let us return for one brief moment
to the northern aisle, to glance at the grave of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Duchess who fought so boldly by her husband’s side
at Durazzo. It is easy to find, for her simple tomb
stands not far from the beautiful and elaborate
monument of Margaret of Durazzo (strange coincidence!)
wife of King Charles of Naples, wherein
the sculptor has portrayed angels drawing aside a
curtain so as to display the sleeping form of the dead
Queen within. Close to this monument of a not
unusual Renaissance type, we discover the last resting
place of Robert Guiscard’s second wife, the Duchess
Sigilgaita, their son Roger Bursa and their grandson
William, in whom the direct line of the Great Adventurer
became extinct. Many stories are told by
the old chroniclers of this bold intrepid princess (not
always to her credit)—daughter of the last Lombard
prince Gisulf of Salerno and wife of her father’s
supplanter, whose humble Norman ancestry she affected
to despise. But despite her reputation for cruelty
and even for murder, Sigilgaita was a faithful wife
and a brave woman, with a character not unlike that
of our own Queen Margaret of Anjou; and it seems
strange that so devoted and well mated a pair as
herself and Robert Guiscard should be separated in
death, he at Venosa and she in the cathedral of
her husband’s foundation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Passing out of the silent church into the warm
light of eventide, by steep alleys and by stony
footpaths we <a name="corr189" id="corr189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">gradually</span> mount upwards towards the
ruined castle that commands a lofty position with an all-embracing
view of the bay and its encircling mountains.
The crumbling fragment of the old palace of Salerno
differs but little in appearance from any one of those
innumerable dilapidated piles of the Middle Ages with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which Southern Italy is so thickly studded, yet
coming fresh from visiting Guiscard’s cathedral and
Hildebrand’s last resting-place, we find it comparatively
easy to conjure up some recollections of its
past, so as to invest its crumbling red-hued walls
with a spell of interest. These broken apertures
were surely once the windows through which the
dying Pope must have wearily glanced upon the
sun-smitten waves and violet-shadowed hills that we
behold to-day; here in this embrasure, long despoiled
of its marble seat, must have brooded the fierce and
unscrupulous Sigilgaita, thinking of how best to rid
herself of her step-son Bohemond, in order that her
own children might inherit their father’s realms.
The ghosts of princes and popes are around us, yet
the only living inhabitant of the roofless castle is
the ragged little goat-herd, whose unsavoury charges
are cropping the short grass that covers the site of
the banqueting hall, where Norman knights and
Italian barons once caroused in the crusading days
of long ago. We seat ourselves on the dry sward
in a sun-warmed angle of the ruins, where an almond
tree that has sprouted from the rubble sends down
from time to time upon our heads a tiny shower of
pale pink blossoms at the bidding of the soft evening
breeze. At our feet are masses of the dark shiny leaves
of the wild arum, and rank grass which is plentifully
starred with tall-stemmed crimson-petalled daisies
and the mauve wind-flowers that are drowsily closing
their cups at the approach of night. The little goat-herd
eyes us solemnly, but—strange and welcome to
relate—shows no inclination to pester the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">signori</span></span>.
The soft murmuring of the distant sea, the subdued
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hum of the city far below us and the drowsy buzzing
of the bees in the almond and ivy bloom close at
hand combine to strengthen the golden chain of
imagination. As we sit basking in the peaceful
beauty of the scene around us and serenely conscious
of its glorious past, one of our party suddenly remembers
in a welcome flash of inspiration that this deserted
courtyard has been made the scene of one of
Boccaccio’s most famous tales. It is a story that
many writers of succeeding ages have endeavoured
to imitate in prose or verse, but this fictitious love-tragedy
between a princess and a page at Salerno has
a simple charm and dignity in its original setting
that only the master-hand of the Tuscan author
could impart. The scene of the novel of Guiscard
and Ghismonda is laid, as we have said, at this very
spot, and as the hero, the heroine and the villain of
the tale have Norman names, we may be allowed
to conjecture that this graceful story, which Boccaccio
puts into the mouth of the lady Fiammetta, was
founded upon some actual but half-forgotten family
scandal in the annals of the mighty but self-made
House of Hauteville.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Once upon a time there reigned in Salerno the
Prince Tancred, who was a widower, and the father
of an only daughter, Ghismonda, Duchess of Capua.
The Duchess, who was considered one of the most
beautiful, accomplished and virtuous princesses of
her day, had been early married to the Duke of
Capua, but on his death after a very few years
of matrimony had been left a childless widow.
Being still very young, the Princess Ghismonda was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>now taken back to his court by her father, who
jealously guarded her and seemed unwilling for her
to be remarried. Living in rooms that over-looked
the courtyard of the palace, the Duchess, who found
time hang on her hands somewhat heavily, used to
spend hours daily in watching the lords and pages
of her father’s household passing and repassing the
quadrangle below, and amongst the many well-favoured
youths a certain page named Guiscard
found most favour in her sight. Now Guiscard, who
had thus all unwittingly attracted Ghismonda’s attention
and finally won her heart, was a young Norman of
no great lineage and of small means, but being discreet,
upright and sensible-minded, had obtained a
high place in Prince Tancred’s estimation. Skilfully
questioning her maids of honour without exciting
their suspicions, the Princess gained all she wished
to know concerning Guiscard’s position and attainments,
and it was not long before she found means of
conveying the secret of her affection to the youth,
who in fact had already fallen head over ears in
love with the beautiful Duchess who so often
leaned from the casement above. She now sent him
a letter hidden in a pair of bellows, wherein she
explained to him the existence of a secret passage,
long disused, that led from a hollow in the hillside
below the castle walls up to her own apartment.
Over-joyed at receiving this missive, the infatuated
page took the first occasion, as we may well imagine,
to make use of this friendly clue, and before many
hours had passed after receiving the letter, the young
man, flushed and triumphant, was standing in the
chamber of his beloved mistress, who had meanwhile
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>taken every necessary preparation for receiving her
lover in secret. Many a time were the pair able to
meet thus without awakening the least suspicion in
the minds of Prince Tancred or of the maids of
honour, and all would doubtless have gone well for
an indefinite period of time, but for a most unforeseen
accident. It appears that one morning the old Prince
of Salerno, wishing to confer with his daughter on
some matter of state, came to her private apartment,
and on learning that she had gone out riding settled
himself upon a couch that stood within a curtained
alcove, and whilst waiting for her return fell sound
asleep. After some hours of repose the prince was
suddenly roused from his heavy slumber by the sound
of two voices in the room, that of his daughter and of
a strange man. Peeping stealthily through the folds
of the draperies, he now beheld to his fury and
amazement the Duchess alone with his page Guiscard.
But the descendant of Robert the Wiseacre well knew
how to temper vengeance with dissimulation. Dreading
the scandal that would follow an open exposure,
the Prince, in spite of his years and the stiffness of
his joints, contrived to quit the chamber unperceived
by means of a convenient window. That very night
the unsuspecting Guiscard was seized by his sovereign’s
orders and thrust into a foul dungeon of the palace,
whither Tancred himself descended to question his
prisoner and to reprove him violently for his base
ingratitude. But the unhappy page could only make
repeated answer: <span class="tei tei-q">“Sire, love hath greater powers
than you or I!”</span> On the following morning Tancred
proceeded to visit the Duchess, still ignorant of her
paramour’s fate, and in a voice strangled with the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>conflicting emotions of paternal love and desired
vengeance bitterly upbraided his erring child.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Daughter, I had such an opinion of your modesty
and virtue, that I could never have believed, had I
not seen it with mine own eyes, that you would have
violated either, even so much as in thought. The
recollection of this will make the pittance of life that
is left very grievous to me. As you were determined
to act in that manner, would to Heaven you had
made choice of a person more suitable to your own
quality; but this Guiscard is one of the meanest
persons about my court. This gives me such concern,
that I scarce know what to do. As for him, he was
secured by my order last night, and his fate is determined.
But with regard to yourself, I am influenced
by two different motives: on one side, the tenderest
regard that a father can have for a child; and on the
other, the justest vengeance for the great folly you
have committed. One pleads strongly in your behalf;
and the other would excite me to do an act contrary
to my nature. But before I come to a resolution, I
would fain hear what you have to say for yourself.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Seeing clearly from her father’s words that her
secret had been discovered and that her lover was
in prison, the intrepid Ghismonda, a true daughter
of the high-spirited House of Hauteville, assuming
a composure she was very far from feeling, made a
dignified appeal on behalf of Guiscard and herself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Father, it is not my purpose either to deny or to
entreat; for as the one can avail me nothing, so I
intend the other shall be of little service. I will by
no means bespeak your love and tenderness towards
me; but shall first, by an open confession, endeavour
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to vindicate myself, and thus do what the greatness
of my soul prompts me to. It is most true that I
have loved, and do still love Guiscard; and whilst I
live, which will not be long, shall continue to love
him; and if such a thing as love be after death, I
shall never cease to love him.... It appears from
what you say, that you would have been less incensed
if I had made choice of a nobleman, and you bitterly
reproach me for having condescended to a man of
low condition. In this you speak according to vulgar
prejudice, and not according to truth; nor do you
perceive that the fault you blame is not mine, but
Fortune’s, who often exalts the unworthy, and leaves
the worthiest in low estate. But, not to dwell on
such considerations, look a little into first principles,
and you will see that we are all formed of the same
material and by the same hand. The first difference
amongst mankind, who are all born equal, was made
by virtue; they who were virtuous were deemed
noble, and the rest were all accounted otherwise.
Though this law, therefore, may have been obscured
by contrary custom, yet is it discarded neither by
nature nor good manners. If you regard only the
worth and virtue of your courtiers, and consider that
of Guiscard, you will find him the only noble person,
and these others a set of poltroons. With regard to
his worth and valour, I appeal to yourself. Who ever
commended man more for anything that was praise-worthy
than you have commended him? And
deservedly, in my judgment; but if I was deceived,
it was by following your opinion. If you say, then,
that I have had an affair with a person base and
ignoble, I deny it; if with a poor one, it is to your
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shame to have let such merit go unrewarded. Now
concerning your last doubt, namely how you are to
deal with me: use your pleasure. If you are disposed
to commit an act of cruelty, I shall say nothing
to prevent such a resolution. But this I must apprise
you of; that unless you do the same to me, which
you either have done, or mean to do to Guiscard, mine
own hands shall do it for you. If you mean to act
with severity, cut us off both together, if it appear to
you that we have deserved it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Duchess’ able defence of her choice of Guiscard
and her democratic views of society were hardly
likely to influence the proud tyrant of Salerno,
although his house was sprung from a plebeian stock
of Normandy. Ignoring her plea and arguments,
Tancred left his daughter alone with her grief, and
proceeded to the cells below to give the order for
Guiscard’s immediate death by strangling. But
Tancred’s fury was by no means appeased by the
page’s death, for tearing the unhappy youth’s heart
from the warm and still quivering body, the brutal
prince had the bleeding flesh placed in a golden
covered cup, which he bade his chamberlain deliver to
Ghismonda, with these cruel words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Your father
sends this present to comfort you with what was
most dear to you; even as he was comforted by you
in what was most dear to him.”</span> With a calm
countenance and with a gracious word of thanks, the
Princess accepted the gift, and on removing the
cover and realising the contents of the cup, said with
meaning to the bearer of this gruesome present:
<span class="tei tei-q">“My father has done very wisely; such a heart as
this requires no worse a sepulchre than one of gold.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Then after lamenting for a while over her lover’s fate,
Ghismonda filled the goblet with a draught of poison
that she had already prepared in anticipation of her
father’s vengeance, and quaffed its contents. After
this she lay down upon her bed, clasping the cup to
her bosom, whereupon her maids, all ignorant of the
cause of their mistress’ conduct, ran terrified to call
Prince Tancred, who arrived in time to witness his
unhappy daughter’s death agony. Now that it was
too late, the Prince was stricken with remorse and
began loudly to bewail the violence of his late anger.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Sire,”</span> said the dying Princess, <span class="tei tei-q">“save those tears
against worse fortune that may happen, for I want
them not. Who but yourself would mourn for a
thing of your own doing?”</span> Then dropping her tone
of irony, she made one last request of her weeping
and repentant father, that her own and Guiscard’s
bodies might be honourably interred within the same
tomb. Thus perished by her own hand the beautiful
Princess Ghismonda of Salerno, Duchess of Capua,
urged to the fell deed by a parent’s inexorable cruelty.
And it is some slight consolation to the sad ending
of the story to learn that Tancred did at least carry
out his daughter’s dying entreaty, for the bodies of
Ghismonda and Guiscard were duly laid in one grave
amidst the pomp of religion and the cold comfort of
a public mourning.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>

But the sun has long since sunk below the horizon,
and the chill dews of night are falling round us. Hastily
we leave the old palace of the princes of Salerno to the
solitary occupation of the bats and owls, to seek warmth
and cheerfulness in our inn upon the Marina.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In these days of easy travelling there lies a choice
of two routes to Paestum and its temples: one
by driving thither direct from La Cava or Salerno,
in the mode of our forefathers; and the other by
taking the train to the little junction of Battipaglia,
and thence proceeding southward by the coast line
to the station of Pesto itself, that stands almost
within a stone’s throw of the chief gate of Poseidonia.
A third, and perhaps a preferable way, consists in
using the railway beyond Battipaglia to Eboli, a
town of no little interest in the upper valley of the
Silarus, and thence driving along the base of the
rocky hills that enclose the maritime plain and through
the oak wood of Persano that was brigand-haunted
within living memory. But though the scenery
between Eboli and Paestum undoubtedly owns more
charm and variety than the marshy flats can boast,
yet the strange loneliness of the sea-girt level has
a fascination of its own, which will appeal strongly
to all lovers of pristine undisturbed nature. For
the larger portion of these Lucanian plains still
remains uncultivated, so that thickets of fragrant
wild myrtle and lentisk, of coronella and of white-blossomed
laurustinus, stud the landscape; whilst
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the open ground is thickly covered with masses of
hardy but gay flowering weeds. The great star-thistles
run to seed unchecked by the scythe, and the
belled cerinthia and the glaucous-leaved tall yellow
mulleins seem to thrive heartily on the barren soil.
Boggy ground alternates with patches of dry stony
earth, and in early summer every little pool of water
affords sustenance to coarse-scented white water-lilies,
and clumps of the yellow iris that are over-shadowed
by masses of tall graceful reeds. These <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">arundini</span></span>,
which are to be found near every water-course or
pool throughout Italy, are characteristic of the country
with their broad grey leaves, their heads of pink
feathery bloom, and their mournful whispering answers
to the question of every passing breeze; elegant in
their growth, they are also beloved by the practical
peasant who utilizes their long slender stems for
a variety of purposes in his domestic economy.
For the reeds, stripped of their foliage, support his
tender young vines and make good frame-work
whereon to train his peas and tomatoes; the longest
canes of all, moreover, serve well as handles for the
long feather brushes which are used so extensively
in all Italian households. Other floral denizens of
the plain are the great rank <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">porri</span></span>, or wild leeks, conspicuous
with their bright green curling leaves issuing
from globe-like roots above the ground, and of course,
the asphodel, the plant of Death. For the asphodel
is pre-eminently the flower of Southern Italy and of
Sicily, since it presents a fit emblem of a departed
grandeur that is still impressive in its decay. How
beautiful to the eye appear the dark grey-green sword-like
leaves from the centre of which up-shoots the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tall branching stem with its clusters of delicate pink-striped
blossoms, that show so lovely yet smell so
vile! Apart from its fetid odour, the asphodel is a
thing of intense beauty, so that a long line of these
plants in full bloom, covering some ridge of orange-coloured
tufa or the velvety-grey crest of some ancient
wall, with their spikes of starry flowers standing out
distinct like floral candelabra against the clear blue
of a southern sky, makes an impression upon the
beholder that will ever be gratefully remembered.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But flowers and shrubs are not the only occupants
of the Poseidonian plain, for as we proceed on our way
towards the Temples, we notice in the drier pastures
large herds of the long-horned dove-coloured cattle of
the country, whilst in marshy places our interest is
aroused by the sight of great shaggy buffaloes of
sinister mien. The buffalo has long been acclimatized
in Italy, though its original home seems to have been
the trackless marshes of the Tigris and Euphrates.
The conquering Arabs first introduced these uncouth
Eastern cattle into Sicily, whence they were imported
into Italy by the Norman kings of Naples. In spite
of its malevolent nature and the poor quality of its
flesh and hide, the buffalo came to be extensively bred
in the Pontine and Lucanian marshes, where the
moisture of the soil and the unwholesome air always
affected the native herds unfavourably. For hours
together these fierce untameable beasts love to lie
amidst the swampy reed-beds, wallowing up to their
flanks in slimy malodorous mud and seemingly
impervious to the ceaseless attacks of the local wasps
and gad-flies, which try in vain to penetrate with their
barbed stings the thick hairy covering of defence.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Perchance between Battipaglia and Paestum we may
encounter a herd of these shaggy beeves being driven
by a peasant on horse-back, with his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pungolo</span></span> or small
lance in hand: a human being that in his goat-skin
breeches and with his luxuriant untrimmed locks,
seems to our eyes only one degree less savage and
unkempt than the fierce beasts he guides. As cultivation
has made progress of recent years and the
unhealthy marshes of the coast line are being gradually
drained, the numbers of buffalo tend to decrease, whilst
the native Italian oxen are being introduced once
more into the newly reclaimed pastures. That former
arch-enemy of the cattle in the days of Vergil seems
to have disappeared: that <span class="tei tei-q">“flying pest,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">asilo</span></span> of
the Romans and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">aestrum</span></span> of the Greeks, which in
antique times was wont to drive the grazing herds
frantic with terror and pain, until the valley of the
Tanager and the Alburnian woods re-echoed with the
agonised lowing of the poor tortured creatures. And
speaking of noxious insects, a general belief prevails
in Italy that their bite—as well as that of snakes and
scorpions—becomes more acute and dangerous when
the sun enters into the sign of Lion, so that human
beings, as well as defenceless cattle, must carefully
avoid all chances of being bitten during the months of
July and August.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Before our goal can be reached it is necessary for
us to cross the broad willow-fringed stream of the Sele,
the Silarus of antiquity, which according to the testimony
of Silius Italicus once possessed the property of
petrifying wood. In the distant days of the eighteenth
century, the traveller to Paestum had to endure amidst
other difficulties and dangers of the road the
disagree<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>able business of being ferried across the Sele, which
was then bridgeless. Owing to the malaria and the
loneliness of the spot, the acting of ferryman over this
river was not an agreeable post, and Count Stolberg,
a German dilettante who has left some memories of
his Italian wanderings, relates how a feeble dismal
soured old man, a veritable Charon of the upper air,
had great difficulty in conveying himself, his horse
and his servant across the swollen stream. The old
man’s age and misery aroused the Count’s compassion,
so that he asked him why he continued thus to perform
a task at once so arduous and so distasteful.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> replied the boatman, <span class="tei tei-q">“I would gladly be
excused, but that my master compels me to undertake
this work.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“And who, pray, is this tyrant of a
master of yours?”</span> indignantly enquired the Count.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Sir, it is my Lord Poverty!”</span> grimly answered the
old ferryman, as he pocketed the Teuton’s fee. Times
have changed with regard to the necessity of a ferry
over the Sele, but to judge from the appearance of the
people and from the accounts in the journals, we much
doubt if my Lord Poverty’s sway has been much
weakened in these parts.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At length we reach the tiny hamlet and station of
Pesto, surrounded by its groves of mournful eucalyptus
trees, and if we visit the station itself, we cannot help
noticing the fine gauze net-work over every window
and door, also the veiled faces and be-gloved hands
of the station-master and his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">facchini</span></span>. It is not
difficult to gauge the reason of the eucalyptus trees at
Pesto, an alien importation like the buffalo, for these
native trees of Australia have been planted here with
the avowed object of reducing the malaria, for which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the place is only too renowned. Scientists have
positively declared that the mosquitoes which rise in
clouds from the poisonous swamps at sunset are
directly responsible for this terrible form of ague, and
a paternal Government has accordingly introduced
gum-trees to improve the quality of the air, and has
presented gloves, veils and fine lattice work to its
servants in the hope of protecting them from the bites
of these tiny pestilence-bearing insects. We do not
wish to dispute the wisdom of modern bacteriologists,
but somehow we have no great faith in this elaborate
scheme for battling with Nature; and indeed not a
few persons who have studied the matter declare that
though the reeking marshes are certainly productive of
malaria in themselves (so much so that it is dangerous
to linger amidst the ruined temples of an evening), yet
these spiteful little creatures are at least innocent of
innoculating humanity with this particular disease.
Moreover, a plausible idea that is now largely held
insists that the recent spread of cultivation over the
Lucanian Plain is itself largely responsible for the
increase of malaria; it is the up-turning of the germ-impregnated
earth that has lain fallow for centuries,
say the supporters of this theory, which awakens and
sets free the slumbering demon of fever in the soil,
so that the speeding of the plough on the Neapolitan
coast must inevitably mean also the spreading of this
fell and mysterious sickness. Let us therefore give
the devil his due: the mosquito is a hateful and
persistent foe, and his sting is both painful and disfiguring,
but do not let us accuse him of carrying
malaria until the case can be better proved against
him. But enough of fevers and doctors’ saws! Let
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>us turn our willing eyes towards the three great
temples that confront us close at hand. Before however
proceeding to inspect these great monuments of
Grecian art and civilization, which rank amongst the
most venerable as well as the most beautiful relics of
antiquity, it is only meet that we should carry with
us into their ruined halls a few grains of historical
knowledge, whereby our sense of reality and our
appreciation of their greatness and splendour may be
increased.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although we do not possess a definite history of
Paestum, similar to that of Rome or of Athens, yet
from the many allusions to be found scattered throughout
the pages of classical historians, as well as from
the various inscriptions and devices found upon ancient
coins of this city, it is not a difficult task to piece
together the main features of Poseidonian annals.
From a very remote period of antiquity there was
undoubtedly a settlement on or near the coast to the
south of the river Silarus, whilst it is commonly held
that this spot was called Peste—a name almost
identical with the modern Italian appellation—many
hundreds of years before the arrival of Doric settlers
on the shores of the Tyrrhene Sea. Late in the
seventh century before Christ, the Greek colony of
Poseidonia, the city of the Sea God, was founded on
or near the site of Italian Peste by certain Hellenic
adventurers from Trœzen, who were amongst the inhabitants
of Sybaris, at that time one of the most
flourishing of the famous cities of Magna Graecia:
and this new colony of Trœzenians henceforward was
accounted one of the twenty-five subject-towns that
recognised Sybaris for their metropolis, or mother and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>suzerain city. We have no details of its early history,
but it is quite certain that under the protection of
Sybaris the new city of Poseidonia rose by degrees to
such wealth and importance that in course of time it
gave its own name to the whole Bay of Salerno, which
henceforth became known to the Greeks as the
Poseidonian Gulf and later, to the Romans, as the
Bay of Paestum. With the fall of the mother city,
this flourishing colony was left alone to face the attacks
of the Samnites, the native barbarians who peopled
the dense forests and the barren mountains of Lucania;
yet it somehow contrived to retain its independence
until the close of the fourth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%">B.C.</span></span>, when the
Samnite hordes, forcing the fortified line of the Silarus,
made themselves masters of Poseidonia, and put an
end, practically for ever, to its existence as a purely
Hellenic city. From its Lucanian masters the
captured town received the name of Paestum, and its
inhabitants were at once deprived of their independence,
were forbidden to carry arms, and were probably
in many instances reduced to the level of serfs. A
large number of Samnites also settled within the walls
of the town, and compelled the former owners to surrender
to them the larger and richer portion of the
public and private lands upon the maritime plain.
The use of the Hellenic language and public worship
were however permitted, and, strange to relate, no
interference was made with a solemn annual festival,
which the depressed and enslaved population now
inaugurated with the confessed object of remembering
for ever their Greek origin and their former greatness.
For once a year at a fixed date all Greeks were wont
to gather together and to bewail in public, outside
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the great temple of Poseidon, their lost liberty and
their vanished power. It is evident that the Lucanians
did not fear the tears and lamentations of this unhappy
subject state, for this custom continued to be observed
throughout the whole period of Samnite oppression,
and survived even till Roman times—perhaps to the
very end of the city’s existence,—although in the
course of passing generations there could have been
but few persons of pure Greek descent left in the place.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With the advent of Alexander of Epirus, who had
been called into Italy by the Greeks of Tarentum in
order to assist the sorely-pressed colonies of Magna
Graecia, Epirot troops were landed at the mouth of
the Silarus. Under the very walls of <a name="corr206" id="corr206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Paestum</span> there
now took place a stubborn fight wherein the army of
the Samnites was completely routed, and its survivors
driven in confusion from the coast into the wild woods
and rocky valleys of the Lucanian hills. For a brief
interval of years Poseidonia regained its lost liberty
and its Hellenic name, but with the overthrow and
death of Alexander of Epirus, the scattered hordes
pressed down once more from their mountain fastnesses
upon the rich plain, and the city was for the
second time enslaved by the ruder conquering race.
Forty years later, after the Pyrrhine war, all Lucania
fell under the rising power of Rome, a change that
was by no means unacceptable to the Greek cities,
which were groaning under the rude tyranny of the
Samnites. A Latin colony was now planted at
<a name="corr206a" id="corr206a" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Paestum</span>, to form a convenient centre whence the
neighbouring district could be kept in order and
peaceably developed according to Roman ideas.
These Roman colonists, although they did not restore
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the lands and buildings held by the expelled Samnites
to their rightful owners, yet lived on terms of amity
with the Greek population, with whom they must have
freely intermarried. The original Hellenic inhabitants,
relieved of the bonds of servitude, were now placed on
an equal footing with the new colonists, partaking of
political rights in the city thus freshly re-created under
the supremacy of Rome, and soon they grew to imitate
the speech and manners of their new masters, so that
as an immediate result of the expulsion of the barbaric
Samnites and the entry of the progressive Romans,
Paestum began to recover a considerable portion of
its ancient splendour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the course of the second Punic War the
name of Paestum is not unfrequently mentioned in
Roman annals, and owing its revived prosperity to its
annexation by Rome, it is not surprising to find the
existence of a strong feeling of gratitude amongst the
inhabitants. At the date of fatal Cannæ this faithful
Greek city sent assurances of unswerving allegiance to
the Senate, and also more substantial help in the
form of all the golden vessels from its temples. It
was Paestum also that early in the third century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%">B.C.</span></span>
supplied part of the ill-fated fleet of Decius Quinctius,
that was raised to run the blockade of Tarentum.
But even the loss of its ships and men did not deter
this loyal city from coming forward a second time
with expressions of fealty and promise of further aid
to the great suzerain city in this dark hour of its
difficulties. From this point onward till the close of
the Republic, History is almost silent with regard to
Paestum; but its numerous coins go far to attest its
continued welfare, for it now shared, together with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Venusia, Brundusium and Vibo Valentia, a special
right to strike money in its own name and with its
own devices. Under the Empire, Paestum managed to
uphold its size and importance, so that it became the
capital of one of the eight Prefectures into which the
district of Lucania had been divided. At this period,
there can be no doubt, the surrounding plain was in
the highest state of cultivation, whilst its prolific rose-gardens—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">biferi
rosaria Paesti</span></span>—have supplied the
theme of every Roman poet from Vergil to Ausonius.
Yet in spite of its apparent prosperity, the seeds of
coming decline had already been sown. Strabo tells
us that even in early Imperial days the city was
obtaining an unenviable reputation for malaria: a
circumstance that was due to the over-flowing of the
unwholesome streamlet, the Salso, whose reeking and
fever-bearing waters began to impregnate the earth.
Engineering works on a large scale were planned to
remedy this drawback, but these were never executed,
and in consequence the unhealthiness of the place
increased. With the decline of the Roman power
the population and prosperity of Paestum likewise
tended to lessen, so that its citizens were placed in a
worse position than before with regard to the carrying
out of this vast but necessary scheme of sanitation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In a spot so accessible to external influence, it is
easy to understand that Christianity early took root
in Paestum, which in the fifth century of our own era
had already become a bishopric. The story of the
growth of the Faith in Lucania is closely connected
with a legend that centres round a native of the place,
a certain Gavinius, a general in the army of the
Emperor Valentinian, who whilst serving in Britain
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>against the Picts by some means succeeded in obtaining
a valuable relic, supposed to be nothing less
than the body of the Apostle Matthew, which he
brought back with him to his native place. Early in
the ninth century there appeared a fresh cause of
alarm, more serious and far-reaching even than the
dreaded malaria, for plundering Saracens, foes alike
to the old Roman civilisation and to the new Christian
creed, now began to harass the Tyrrhenian shores.
Settling at Agropoli to the south of the Bay, these
Oriental freebooters found little difficulty in effecting
a landing on the Poseidonian beach, and in raiding
the weakened and almost defenceless city. Able-bodied
men and young maidens were forcibly carried
off to the pirates’ nest at Agropoli, or perhaps even
to the distant coast of Barbary, to be sold into
perpetual slavery. Alarmed beyond measure by this
raid, the remaining inhabitants of the place, at the
advice and under the guidance of their bishop, now
decided—wisely, for they had to choose between
immediate flight or gradual extermination by disease,
slavery and the sword—to remove themselves to the
barren mountains in their rear, once the haunts of
the Samnites, and to build a new Paestum on a site
at once more healthy and better protected by Nature
against the raids of infidel corsairs. In a body therefore
the remaining citizens amid deep wailing left for
ever the ancient city with its glorious temples, and
retired to a strong position to the east. The spot
chosen for the new residence of these exiles lay close
to the source that supplied with pure water their
ancient aqueduct, known for this reason as Caputaqueum,
now corrupted into Capaccio. A link with the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>old city, that lay deserted in the plain below, was still
retained by the bishop of the newly founded town in
the mountains, who continued to be known as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Episcopus
Paestanus</span></span>. In the eleventh century Robert
Guiscard systematically plundered the ruins of Paestum
in order to erect or embellish the churches and palaces
of Salerno and Amalfi. Every remaining piece of
sculpture and of marble was removed, and it was only
the vast size of the pillars of the three great temples,
and the consequent difficulty attending their transport
by boat across the bay or along the marshy ground
of the coast line, that saved from destruction these
magnificent relics of <span class="tei tei-q">“the glory that was Greece.”</span>
But even humble Capaccio did not afford a final
resting-place to the harried Paestani, for in the year
1245 the great Emperor Frederick II., who had been
defied by the feudal Counts of Capaccio, besieged and
utterly destroyed this stronghold of the mountains
that had been the child of Poseidonia of the sea-girt
plains. Another and a yet loftier retreat had to be
sought by the survivors of the Imperial vengeance, so
that the ruined Capaccio the Old was abandoned for
another settlement, which still exists as a miserable
village amidst those barren hills that had ever looked
down with jealous envy upon the proud city with its
pillared temples. One curious circumstance with
regard to Paestum must finally be mentioned, in that
the existence of its ruins, the grandest and most
ancient group of monuments on the mainland of Italy,
remained unknown to the learned world until comparatively
modern times. Only the local peasants
and the inhabitants of the poverty-stricken towns in
the Lucanian hills seem to have been aware of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>presence of the gigantic temples standing in lonely
majesty by the shore and as the superstitious nature
of these ignorant people attributed these structures to
the work of a magician—perhaps to the great wizard
Vergil himself—they were shunned both by night and
by day as the haunt of malignant spirits. Poor
fisher-folk and buffalo-drivers, who had of necessity
to pass near the ruined fanes, were wont to slink by in
fear and trembling, and doubtless they brought back
strange stories of its ghostly occupants with which
they regaled their friends or families by the fire-side
of a winter’s evening. Yet it is most strange that
during the period of the Renaissance, at a time when
enthusiastic research was being made into the neglected
antiquities of Italy, this unique group of Doric
temples should have escaped notice. For neither
Cyriaco of Ancona nor Leandro Alberti, who visited
Lucania ostensibly for the sake of recording its
classical remains, make mention of <span class="tei tei-q">“the ruined
majesty of Paestum,”</span> and it was reserved for a certain
Count Gazola (whose name is certainly worthy of
being recorded), an officer in the service of the
Neapolitan King, to present to the notice of scholars
and archaeologists towards the middle of the eighteenth
century the first known description of what is perhaps
Italy’s chief existing treasure of antiquity. From
Gazola’s day onward the beauty and interest of Paestum
have been appraised at their true worth, and numberless
artists and writers of almost every nationality
have sketched or described its marvellous temples.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With this brief introduction to the history of a city,
whose chief building is still standing almost intact
after a lapse of 2500 years, let us take a rapid survey
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of Poseidonia as it exists to-day. Its walls, of Greek
construction but probably built or restored as late as
the time of Alexander of Epirus, who gave the captured
town a fleeting spell of liberty, form an irregular pentagon
about three miles in circumference, <a name="corr212" id="corr212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">whereon</span> the
remains of eight towers can be observed, whilst the
four gates, placed at the four cardinal points of the
compass, are clearly traceable. We enter this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">città
morta</span></span> by the so-called Porta della Sirena, the eastern
gate that faces the hostile Samnite Hills and (oh,
the prosaic touch!) the modern railway-station. This
gate remains in a tolerable state of preservation, and
draws its name from the key-stone of its arch, which
bears in low relief a much defaced design of a mermaid
or siren, its counterpart on the inner keystone being a
dolphin: two devices very appropriate to the entrance
of a city dedicated to the Lord of Ocean. Passing
the picturesque yellow-washed Villa Salati, with its
high walls and iron-barred windows testifying only too
plainly to the lawlessness that once reigned in this
district, we find ourselves face to face with the great
temple of Neptune or Poseidon, and its companion-fane,
the so-called Basilica. The Temple of Neptune
(for in this instance at least the popular appellation
chances to be the correct one), in all probability co-eval
with the first Greek foundation of the city, formed
the central point of the life of Poseidonia during the
1400 years of its existence as a Hellenic, a Samnite,
and finally a Roman city. In its simple grandeur and
its perfect proportions this wonderful temple possesses
only one rival outside Greece itself: the Temple of
Concord at Girgenti, which the poet Goethe compared
to a god, after designating the building before us as a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>giant. Superiority in grace is therefore a disputed
point between the two great structures of Poseidonia
and Agrigentum, yet in every other respect the temple
of the Lucanian Plain surpasses its Sicilian rival.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To-day, after more than a score of centuries of
exposure to the salt winds and to the burning sunshine
of the south, the walls and pillars of these great buildings
have been calcined to a glorious shade of tawny
yellow, fit to delight the soul of every artist, whether
he views their Titanic but graceful forms outlined
against the deep blue of sky and sea on the western
horizon, or against the equally lovely background of
grey and violet mountains to the east. But it was
not always thus. The porous local travertine that gave
their building material to the Greeks of the sixth
century before Christ was once carefully stuccoed, and,
in the manner of Hellenic art, painted in the most
brilliant hues of azure and vermilion, so that it becomes
hard for us to realise the original effect of such
gorgeous masses standing erect in a landscape that is
itself fraught with glowing colour. But better to
appreciate the magnificence before us, let us give a
brief technical description of the greatest of the temples
in the choice words of an eminent French antiquary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The largest and most elegant, and likewise the
oldest of the Temples of Paestum, is that commonly
known by the name of the Temple of Neptune. This
building shares, together with the Temple of Theseus
at Athens, the honour of being the best preserved
monument of the Doric order in existence, and the
impression of grandeur that it gives to the spectator rivals
even the first sight of the Parthenon itself. In front of
the building is a platform in the midst of which can be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>seen the hollow space that formerly held the altar of
sacrifice, for according to the practice of the Greek
religion, these rites of blood-shedding took place in the
open air and outside the temple. With a length of
190 feet and a breadth of 84 feet, this building is
hypoethral, which means that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cella</span></span>, or sanctuary
that held the statue of the deity, was constructed open
to the sky. It is peripteral, and presents a row of
six pillars fluted at base and top, with twelve on each
side, making thirty-six in all. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cella</span></span> itself in the
interior is upheld by sixteen columns about six feet
in diameter, which in their turn are surmounted by
two rows of smaller pillars above that support the roof.
With the exception of one side of the upper stage of
the interior every column of the temple remains intact,
as do likewise the entablature and pediments. Only
the wall of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cella</span></span> has been pulled down; doubtless
to supply material for building.”</span><a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having quoted Monsieur Lenormant’s careful
description of the chief pride of Poseidonia, we shall
confine ourselves to as few remarks as possible concerning
the two remaining temples. The Basilica, a
misnomer of which the veriest amateur must at once
perceive the absurdity, is inferior both in size and in
beauty of proportion to its close neighbour of Neptune.
Its chief peculiarity from an architectural point of view
will be at once remarked, for it has its two façades
composed of seven—an odd number—of columns, so
that its interior easily divides itself into two narrow
chambers of equal length, affording ample ground for
the theory, now generally held, that this building was
not a hall of Justice, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Basilica</span></span>, but a temple intended
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>expressly for the worship of dual divinities. Almost
without a doubt it was erected—probably not long after
the Temple of Poseidon—in honour of Demeter (Ceres)
and of her only child Persephone (Proserpine), who
was seized from her mother’s care by the amorous god
of the Infernal Regions, as she was plucking anemones
in the verdant meadows of Enna. We all know <span class="tei tei-q">“the
old sweet mythos”</span>; we all understand its hidden
allegory with regard to the sowing, the up-springing
and the garnering of the yellow corn, that spends
half the year in the embraces of the earth, the
palace of Pluto, and half the year on the broad
loving bosom of Mother Demeter. Here then within
these bare and ruined walls were mother and daughter
worshipped by the people of Poseidonia, who reasonably
considered that the two goddesses of the Earth
should have their habitation as near as possible to the
Sanctuary of the Sovereign of Ocean.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Much smaller than either of these immense temples
is the third remaining Greek building of Paestum,
which lies a good quarter of a mile to the north, not
far from the Golden Gate, the Porta Aurea, that leads
northward in the direction of Salerno. Like that of
Neptune, this temple is hexastyle, with six columns on
each of its façades and twelve on either flank, but as it
is little more than half the size of its grander and older
brethren, it is now frequently known as <span class="tei tei-q">“Il Piccolo
Tempio,”</span> although its former incorrect ascription to
Ceres still clings to it in popular parlance. It is from
this building, which stands on slightly rising ground,
that the best impression of the whole city and of its
wondrous setting between the savage Lucanian hills
and the blue Mediterranean can be obtained.

Beautiful as Paestum presents itself in the bright
noontide of a Spring day, beneath a cloudless sky
and with the blue waters of the Mediterranean
lapping the distant yellow sands, there appears something
incongruous in the sharp contrast between this
joyfulness of vigorous life and the solemn atmosphere
of the deserted city. The noisy twittering of multitudes
of ubiquitous sparrows, equally at home in Doric
temples as amongst the sooty chimney stacks of
London; the twinklings and rustlings of the lizards
in the young leaves and grass; the polyglot babble
of excursionists from Naples or La Cava that a warm
day in Spring invariably attracts to Paestum:—these
are not sounds that blend well with the solemn spirit
of the place. We long to cross the intervening ages
so as to throw ourselves, if only for one short hour,
outside the cares and interests of to-day into the heart
of that refined civilisation which is gone for ever;—with
the cheerful sunlight around us, and with our
fellow-mortals on pleasure bent close at hand, we find
it difficult to forget the present. Would it be possible,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>we ask ourselves, to spend a nocturnal vigil within the
hall of the great temple of the Sea God, so as to
behold, like that undaunted traveller, Crawford Ramage,
the shafts of crystalline moonlight shed through the
aperture of the roof leap from pillar to pillar, making
bars of brilliant light amidst the surrounding blackness!
O to sit and meditate thus engrossed with the memory
of the past, and with no other sounds around us than
the sad cry of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">aziola</span></span>, the little downy owl
that Shelley so loved! But the gaunt spectre of
Fever ever haunts this spot, and after sunset his power
is supreme; so that he would be a bold man indeed
who in an age of luxury and selfish comfort would
carry out an idea at once so romantic and so perilous.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We ourselves were especially fortunate on the
occasion of our last visit to Poseidonia on a mild
day in December, a month which on the Lucanian
shore somewhat resembles a northern October. A
soft luminous haze hung over the landscape and over
the Bay of Salerno itself, rendering the classic mountains
at once indistinct in outline and unnaturally
lofty to the eye. More grandiose and mysterious
than under the fierce light of a sunny noontide
appeared that day the three giant pillared forms, as
we entered the precincts of the ruined city by the
Siren’s Gate, and made our way through the thick
herbage still pearled with dew, since there was neither
sunshine nor sirocco to dry <span class="tei tei-q">“the tears of mournful
Eve”</span> off the clumps of silver-glinted acanthus, or the
tall grasses bending with the moisture. In the warm
humid air we seated ourselves on the plinth of a
column, and gazing around allowed the influence of
this marvellous spot to sink deep into the soul. No
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tourists with unseemly or unnecessary chatter arrived
that day to share our selfish delight or to break the
all-pervading spell of solitude; all lay peaceful and
deserted. All was silent too save for the low
monotonous sobbing of the sea on the unseen beach
near at hand, the historic beach on which at various
times throughout the roll of past ages Doric colonists,
Epirot warriors, Roman legionaries and fierce Mohammedan
pirates had disembarked, all with the same
object:—to seize the proud city that had now for
the last thousand years lain uninhabited, save for
the owls and the bats. It was too cloudy a day for
sun-loving creatures such as lizards or serpents to
emerge and rustle amongst the broken stones and
leaves, over all of which during the silent hours of
the past night Arachne had been employed in weaving
her softest and whitest textures, that the windless
morning had allowed to remain intact. The only sign
of animate life was visible in a pair of lively gold-finches,
which with merry notes were fluttering from
thistle to thistle, picking the down from each ripened
flower-head and prodigally scattering the seeds upon
the weed-grown soil where once had bloomed the
odorous Roses of Paestum that the poets loved.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sitting thus amid the silence and solitude of a city
half as old as Time itself, we were unexpectedly
aroused by a gruff salutation proceeding from a little
distance behind the temple. Turning quickly in the
direction of the sound, we perceived the figure of a
tall bearded man dressed in conical hat, with goat-skin
trousers and cross-gartered legs, who but for the gun
slung across his shoulders by a stout leathern strap
might well have been mistaken for an apparition of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the god Pan himself returned to earth. Vague recollections
of the brigand Manzoni, the scourge of the
neighbourhood and the murderer of more than one
unhappy visitor to the ruins of Paestum in the good
old <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vetturino</span></span> days, flashed through our mind, as we
surveyed the muscular frame and the fowling-piece
of the strange being before us. It was with a sigh
of relief that we noted upon the straight stretch of
white road leading to the Little Temple in the distance
the presence of two royal <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">carabinieri</span></span> majestically
riding at a foot’s pace, their tall forms enveloped in
long black cloaks whose folds swept over their horses’
tails. We felt reassured, and when for a second
time the guttural voice addressed us in unintelligible
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">patois</span></span>, we perceived the innocent object of this
mysterious visit. Searching in a capacious goat-skin
bag, a species of Neapolitan sporran, this descendant
of the Poseidonian Greeks produced and held up to
our gaze three birds that he had shot in his morning’s
hunting. For the modest sum of three lire the game
exchanged hands, and the sportsman departed, well
satisfied with his luck. Next evening we feasted
royally in our inn at Salerno upon a succulent woodcock
fattened upon the berries of the wood of Persano,
and upon a couple of snipe that had grown plump
amongst the Neptunian marshes. Nor was this dainty
addition to our supper that night altogether undeserved;
for having decided in a momentary fit of
enthusiasm to forego the usual basket of hotel food
at the time of starting from Salerno, in order to follow
the advice of old Evelyn <span class="tei tei-q">“to diet with the natives,”</span>
we had preferred to take our chance of midday refreshment
at the solitary <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">osteria</span></span> within the ruined
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>city wall. The good people of the inn did what they
could to regale the two <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gran’ signori Inglesi</span></span>, whose
unexpected presence had the effect of creating some
stir within their humble walls. No little time was
expended in bustling preparations, before a flask of
red wine, some coarse bread, a dish of fried eggs and
a plateful of cold sausage were placed before us upon
the rough oak table, well scored with knife-cuts.
Eggs, wine and bread are usually tolerable everywhere
throughout Italy, no matter how mean the inn that provides
them; but the Lucanian sausage, though interesting
as a relic of classical times, is positive poison to
the Anglo-Saxon digestion. For the Lucanian sausage
of to-day is the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lucanica</span></span> unchanged; the same tough,
greasy, odoriferous compound, in fact, that Cicero
describes as <span class="tei tei-q">“an intestine, stuffed with minced pork,
mixed with ground pepper, cummin, savory, rue,
rock-parsley, berries of laurel, and suet.”</span> And we
have only to add that mingling with the above-mentioned
condiments there was an all-pervading
flavour of wood-smoke, due to the sausage’s place of
storage, a hook within the kitchen chimney. But if
the fare was rough, it was cheap and smacked of
classical times, and our reception by the Paestani of
to-day was most cordial.

We left Poseidonia late in the afternoon, casting
back many regretful glances at the three giant sentinels
of the plain, looming preternaturally large in the
rapidly fading light of a starless evening. At that
hour we felt we could understand and sympathise
with the poor untutored peasant’s fear and avoidance
of these lonely ruins, for superstition is often as much
the result of chance environment as of crass ignorance.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been said of more than one spot on this
globe, that it was so beautiful in summer the
marvel was to think any one could die there; and so
wretched in winter, it was a miracle for its inhabitants
to survive. Sorrento may be said to belong to this
class of place, for the climate of its short winter is one
of the most trying and inclement that can possibly be
imagined, whilst during spring, summer and early
autumn it well merits its local reputation as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">il piccolo
paradiso</span></span> of the Bay of Naples, and its air is considered
by Neapolitans as the <span class="tei tei-q">“balm in Gilead”</span> for every evil
to which human flesh is heir. The Lactarian Mountains
protect the plain of Sorrento in summer from the
scorching rays of the sun, and lay their beneficent
shadow for several hours of the long hot summer’s day
over the many thousands who dwell on the fertile
Piano di Sorrento at their base. But in winter these
same hills intercept the blessed sunshine, which is what
most travellers speed southwards to obtain, and leave
the coast line from Castellamare to the Punta di
Sorrento with its northern aspect wrapped in shade
and moisture, whilst the remainder of the Bay is still
basking in the genial warmth, so that anything more
miserable than a mid-winter sojourn in Sorrento it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>would be impossible to conceive. There are of course
calm warm days to be met with even in December and
January, but these are occasional and by no means
dependable blessings, and the visitor who persists in
taking up his abode here at this season of the year
must prepare himself to experience cold, damp, wind
and rain, without any of the contrivances or comforts
of a northern winter. <span class="tei tei-q">“One swallow does not make a
summer,”</span> and on the same principle a southern latitude
and the presence of orange groves do not necessarily
imply a salubrious climate; indeed, the sub-tropical
surroundings seem to add an extra degree of chilliness
to the place. To sit at Christmastide in a large lofty
room before a meagre fire of sputtering smoky logs,
with Vesuvius wrapped from crest to base in a white
mantle of new fallen snow, and with an icy <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tramontana</span></span>
from the bleak Abruzzi howling round the house, bending
the bay trees and penetrating into every corner of
the chamber, is by no means the ideal picture of a
winter in the Sunny South; yet this is only what the
traveller must be prepared to face, and is very likely to
obtain. Nor is the cold compensated for by any
advantages in the neighbourhood itself, for there is but
the high road from Castellamare which passes through
the town and leads above the seashore to Massa
Lubrense. It is all very well in its way, but in wet
weather its surface is one sheet of slippery mud, and
the streams pouring down the hillside make it chilly
and damp for all who are not quick walkers. Besides
this not very attractive and soon exploited walk, there
are only the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vicoletti</span></span>, the narrow steep rocky paths
running up hill, which make rough going and give
little pleasure, for they are almost all bounded on either
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>side by high stone walls that jealously exclude the
view. So much for Sorrento in its winter dress. But
when the spring comes, here truly is a transformation
from cold and torpor! The soft warm air is redolent
of the penetrating fragrance of orange blossom, of
stocks, of jessamine, of wallflower, and of a hundred
odorous plants and shrubs from each garden and grove
behind the many obstructing walls. The balconies
and gate-pillars are draped in scented masses of the
beautiful wistaria, which in Italy produces its long
pendant bunches of purple flowers before putting forth
its bronze-coloured leaves. Cascades of white and
yellow banksia roses fall over each confining barrier,
or else their stems may be seen climbing like huge
serpents up the trunks of pine and olive, to burst forth
amidst the topmost boughs into floral rockets against
the cloudless sky. The ravines with which the whole
of the Piano di Sorrento is intersected are filled with
a perfect jungle of fresh spring foliage, amidst whose
varied tints of green appear here and there the bright
red shoots of the pomegranate trees bursting into leaf.
In the heavily perfumed air at dusk, or when the
bright moonlight is flooding the whole scene and is
turning the Bay into a mirror of molten silver, the song
of the innumerable nightingales can be heard resounding
from all sides; alas! too often sweet songs of
sorrow for nests despoiled by the ruthless hands of
young Sorrentine imps, as in the days of the Georgics.

All is fragrant, warm, genial, and peaceful, save for
the melancholy notes of poor ill-used Philomel, who
is foolish enough to visit a cruel country, wherein
every bird is merely regarded as a toothsome morsel
for the family pot. We bird-lovers of Britain, with
our Selborne Societies and our Wild Birds’ Protection
Acts, find it extremely difficult to understand the
utter indifference displayed by Italians of all classes
towards the feathered race. The whole of the beautiful
country with its cypress hedges and olive groves
lies almost mute and lifeless, for on every festival the
fields and lanes are patrolled by bands of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cacciatori</span></span>
with dogs and guns on the look-out for game, if
blackbirds and sparrows can be accounted such. In
some districts it is even dangerous for pedestrians to
use the roads on a Sunday, for fear of a stray bullet,
since all, as a rule, fire recklessly at any creature
within and out of range. Nor is this senseless war
of extermination carried on merely with guns, for
trapping is used extensively, and very ingenious and
elaborate are some of the arts employed in this
wretched quest. Every country house has its <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">uccellare</span></span>,
or snare for the securing of small birds for the table,
whilst many of the parish priests in the mountain
districts add to their scanty incomes by catching the
fledglings which the young peasants sell in the
neighbouring market. The result is what might
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>only naturally be expected—a scarcity of birds and
an almost complete absence of song, for the whole
countryside has been practically denuded of blackbirds
and thrushes; even the nightingale has escaped
destruction rather on account of its nocturnal habits
than of its tiny size and exquisite notes. It is positively
sickening to observe the quantities of slaughtered
wild birds in an Italian market at any season of the
year, for the work of devastation proceeds apace
equally in spring time. Basketfuls of thrushes and
blackbirds, and strings of smaller varieties—linnets,
sparrows, robins, finches, even the diminutive gold-finches,
most beautiful, most gay, and most innocent
of all songsters—are being hawked about by leathern-lunged
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">contadini</span></span>, who, alas! always manage to find
customers in plenty. No matter how melodious, how
lovely, or how useful to the farmer a bird may be, no
Italian, high or low, seems to have any sense or
appreciation of its merits except as an article of
food; it is merely a thing that requires to be caught,
killed, cooked and eaten, and Providence has decreed
its existence for no other purpose; even gold-finches
in the eye of an Italian look better served on a
skewer than when they are flying round the thistle-heads,
uttering their bright musical notes and enlivening
the dead herbage of winter with their gay
plumage. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Che bel arrosto!</span></span> (what a glorious dish!)
sigh the romantic peasants, as they glance upward
for a moment from their labour in the fields at the
sound of the larks carolling overhead; and though
an educated Italian would probably not give vent to
so vulgar a remark, he would much prefer the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bel
arrosto</span></span> to the <span class="tei tei-q">“profuse strains of unpremeditated art”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that so entrance the northerner, who is in reality far
more of a poet by nature than the more picturesque
dweller of the South. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tantum pro avibus.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As summer advances, the delight of bathing in the
limpid waters of the Bay is added to the other attractions
of Sorrento, whilst many pleasant and profitable
hours can be passed in reading or writing during the
long midday rest in the cool airy carpetless and
curtainless rooms, where on the frescoed ceilings there
plays the green shimmer of light that penetrates
through the closed bars of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">persiani</span></span>, the outside
heavy wooden shutters that let in the sweet air, but
somehow seem to exclude the intense heat. With
the approach of sunset and the throwing open of
casements to catch the westerly breeze, there comes
a delightful ramble, perhaps an excursion on mule-back
to the famous convent of the Deserto or some
other point of interest; or else a row upon the glassy
waters at our feet, to explore <span class="tei tei-q">“Queen Joanna’s Bath,”</span>
or some strange caverns beyond the headland of
Sorrento, well known to our boat-men. That is the
true life of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dolce far niente</span></span>, but such an ideal existence
can only be indulged in during summer time or in
late spring; to pass a winter at Sorrento the heaviest
of clothing, abundance of overcoats and rugs, hot-water
bottles, cough drops, ammoniated quinine and
all the usual adjuncts of a northern yule-tide must
be carefully provided before-hand by the traveller,
who is bold enough to tempt Providence by turning
what is essentially a warm weather retreat into a place
of winter residence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In early autumn also the place has its charms, in
the days when the market is filled with stalls heaped
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with glowing masses of fruit, many of them unknown
to us wanderers from the north. There are peaches
that resemble our own fruit at home, and there are
also great yellow flushed velvety globes, like the sun-kissed
cheeks of a fair Sorrentina, that appear tempting
to the eye, but are in reality tough as leather, for
they are the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cotogni</span></span> or quince-peaches of Italy, which
to our feeble palates and digestions seem only fit for
cooking, though the experienced native contrives to
make them edible by soaking the fruit in wine. The
moment he sits down to table, he carefully pares his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cotogne</span></span> and cuts it into sections, which he drops into
a glass of red wine where they repose until the meal
is finished; by this time the fruit has become
thoroughly saturated, and it is then eaten with
apparent relish. There are hundreds of apples, some
of a shining rich crimson and others of dull yellow
peppered over with tiny black specks, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">renati</span></span>, highly
prized by the natives for their delicate flavour and
soft flesh. There are of course loads of grapes,
varying from the little honey-tasting purple sort, that
has been introduced from California, to the huge but
somewhat insipid bunches of the white <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Regina</span></span>; we
note also the quaintly shaped <span class="tei tei-q">“Ladies’ Fingers,”</span>
which are especially sweet. The figs, massed together
in serried layers between fresh vine leaves and costing
a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">soldo</span></span> the dozen, stand around in glossy purple
pyramids, so luscious that their sugary tears are
exuding from their skins, and so ripe that they seem
to cry to be eaten before noon. Here is a barrow
piled high with the little green fruit, each separate
fig being decorated with a pink cyclamen stuck in its
crest; and here is a smaller load of the black <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vescovo</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which is said to obtain its ecclesiastical name from
the fact that the parent stock of this highly esteemed
variety originally flourished in the bishop’s garden at
Sorrento. No one who has not visited the shores of
the Mediterranean in September or early October can
realize the luscious possibilities of the fig; for there
seems nothing in common between the freshly-picked
fruit of the south, bursting its skin with liquid sugar,
and the dry sweetish woolly object which tries to
ripen on the sheltered wall of an English garden and
is eaten with apparent gusto by those who know not
its Italian brother. Being autumn, we have missed
one prominent feature of the fruit market, the great
green-skinned water-melons (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">poponi</span></span>) with their rose-coloured
pulp and masses of coal-black seeds, which
form the favourite summer fruit of the people, who
find both food and drink in their cool nutritious
flesh. But even gayer and more striking than the
fruits are the piles of vegetables, arranged with a fine
appreciation of colour to which only an Italian eye
can aspire. Carrots, turnips, tomatoes, purple-headed
cauliflowers, all the broccoli and many others to be
observed are old familiar friends, but who in England
ever saw such gorgeous objects on a coster’s stall or
in a green-grocer’s shop as the yellow, scarlet and
shining green pods of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">peperoni</span></span>, or the banana-shaped
egg-plants of iridescent purple, or the split
pumpkins, revealing caverns of saffron-hued pulp
within? Truly, the Sorrentine market contains a
feast of colour to satisfy the craving of an artist!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At vintage time the whole Piano di Sorrento reeks
with the vinous scent of the spilt juice, that is carelessly
thrown on to the stone-paved roads by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>jolting of the country carts which bring in the great
wooden tubs, so that the very streets seem to run with
the crimson ooze. Slender youths in yet more slender
clothing, with legs purple-stained from treading the
grapes (for in the South wine is still made on the
primitive plan), are to be met with on all sides, playing
at their favourite game of bowls on the public road,
in order to relieve their brains of the pungent fumes
of the fermenting grape juice. Somehow at the very
thought of a Campanian vintage with its long hot
dusty days, its bare-legged brown-skinned peasants
treading the pulp, and its all-pervading aroma of wine-lees,
there rise to memory the truly inspired lines of
John Keats:

But all these joys of odorous gardens made musical
by nightingales, of morning plunges into the blue
Mediterranean, of the wealth of southern fruit and the
novel delights of the vintage are not for the winter
traveller, who had far better spend the December or
January days of his visit to the Bay in a steam-heated
Neapolitan hotel, rather than face the cold and wet in
a Sorrentine inn on its overhanging cliff. Nevertheless
the warm autumn often extends itself into a continuous
St Martin’s summer, that lasts almost until the New
Year, before skies grow clouded and the snow-flakes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>descend upon the vineyards and the lava streams of
Vesuvius. Nothing can be pleasanter in fact than
some of the long walks in a sharp exhilarating air, and
though days are short and nights are often chilly, one
can sometimes linger on comfortably in Sorrento,
though it is as well to be prepared for departure in
case of a sudden spell of stormy weather, for winter
sunshine is a necessity, not a luxury, on the Piano di
Sorrento.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Unlike other towns upon the Bay of Naples,
Sorrento is divided into two distinct portions; the city
on the cliffs, with its streets and squares, its cathedral
and ancient walls, its villas and gay gardens; and the
Marina, lying at the mouth of the gorge below, close
to the water’s edge. The population of Upper
Sorrento is agricultural and labouring, whilst that of
the lower consists entirely of fisher-folk and sailors;
it is needless to add that the latter are far less prosperous
than their fellow-citizens who live over-head. Until
recent times little communication between these two
sets of Sorrentines took place and intermarriages were
rare, for the sea-faring population only ascended to the
town above and intermingled with the people of Upper
Sorrento on the great occasions of local festivals, such
as the enthronement or funeral of a bishop. Nor has
the levelling spirit of the age as yet broken down the
deep-rooted feeling of local clannishness; although it
cannot be long before time-honoured customs and
prejudices will be swept away in the tidal wave of
modern development. One of the chief industries of
the place is the manufacture of scarves and sashes of
rich silk woven in cross bars of strong contrasting
colours, so that the Sorrentine silk work strongly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>resembles the well-known Roman variety. Equally
popular with visitors are the various articles made of
olive wood and decorated in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tarsia</span></span>, the art of inlaying
with pieces of stained wood, which is a speciality
of the place. There are two kinds of this Sorrentine
inlaid work; one consisting of figures of peasants
dancing the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tarantella</span></span>, of Pompeian maidens in classical
drapery, of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">contadini</span></span> or priests bestriding mules, and
of similar local subjects; and the other, of fanciful
patterns made up of tiny coloured cubes of wood,
much in the style of the old Roman stone mosaics.
The designs employed vary of course with the fashion
of the day, for there is a local school of art supported
by the municipality, which professes to improve the
tastes of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tarsiatori</span></span>, but most persons will certainly
prefer the trite but characteristic patterns of the place.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the main industry of Sorrento consists in the
culture of the orange; and the dark groves, covered
with their globes of shining yellow fruit, <span class="tei tei-q">“like golden
lamps in a green light,”</span> to quote Andrew Marvell’s
charming conceit, constitute the chief feature of its
environs. Even the coat-of-arms of the medieval city,
showing a golden crown encircled by a wreath of the
dark glossy leaves, attests the antiquity of this industry
here. The cultivation of the orange in Southern Italy
is by no means an easy pursuit, though under favourable
conditions it may prove a very lucrative one, even
in a spot so subject to sudden changes of temperature
as Sorrento in winter time, when a continuance of
severe weather, like that experienced around Naples
in the opening months of the year 1905, means total
destruction of the fruit crop and temporary ruin to the
owners.

The fruit of commerce is propagated by means of
grafting the sweet variety on to the stock of the bitter
orange—said on doubtful authority to be indigenous
to this district—which is fairly hardy and can be
grown in the open as far north as Tuscany, so that
every <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">aranciaria</span></span> ought to possess a nursery of flourishing
young sweet-orange shoots, ready in case of
necessity. For eight long years the grafted tree
remains as a rule profitless, but having survived and
thriven so long, it then becomes a valuable asset to its
proprietor for an indefinite period;—as a proof of the
longevity of the orange under normal conditions we
may cite the famous tree in a Roman convent garden,
which on good authority is stated to have been planted
by St Dominic nearly six hundred years ago. As to
the amount of fruit yielded, the growers of Sorrento
commonly aver that one good year, one bad year and
one mediocre year constitute the general cycle in the
prospects of orange farming. Two crops are gathered
annually, the principle one in December and the other
at Eastertide, the fruit produced by the later and
smaller crop being far finer in size and flavour than
those of the Christmas harvest. Mandarin oranges
are gathered on both occasions, but the large luscious
loose-skinned fruit of March and April—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Portogalli</span></span> as
they are commonly termed—are far superior to the
small hard specimens that appear in December, and
seem to consist of little else than rind, scent and seeds.
The oranges begin to form in spring time, almost
before the petals have fallen, when the peasants
anxiously draw their conclusions as to the expected
yield. But however valuable the fruit, the wood of
the tree is worthless for commerce, except to make
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>walking-sticks, or to serve the ignoble purpose of
supplying hotels and cafés with tooth-picks! Lemons,
which are far more delicate than oranges and require
to be kept protected by screens and matting during
the sharp winter nights, are less common at Sorrento
than on the warmer shores of the Bay of Baia or the
sunny terraced slopes of the Amalfitan coast.

With the ripening of the oranges on the trees appear
those strange creatures from the wilds of the Basilicata
or Calabria, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zampognari</span></span>,  who visit Naples and the
surrounding district in considerable numbers. They
usually arrive about the date of the great popular
festival of the Immaculate Conception (December 8th)
and remain until the end of the month, when they
return to their homes with well-filled purses. In
outward aspect these strangers resemble the stage-brigands
that appear in such old-fashioned operas as
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fra Diavolo</span></span>, for they wear steeple-crowned hats with
coloured ribands depending, shaggy goat-skin trousers,
crimson velvet waistcoats, blue cloaks, sandalled feet
and gartered legs. Their pale faces are unshorn, and
their hair hangs in great tawny masses over neck
and ears, which are invariably adorned with golden
rings. These fellows come in pairs, one only, properly
speaking, being the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">zampognaro</span></span>, for it is he who carries
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">zampogna</span></span> or classical bag-pipe of Southern Italy,
whilst his companion is the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cennamellaro</span></span>, so called
from his ear-splitting instrument, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cennamella</span></span>, a
species of primitive flute. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">zampogna</span></span> may be
described as first cousin to the historic bag-pipes of
Caledonia, for the sounds emitted strongly resemble
the traditional <span class="tei tei-q">“skirling”</span> of the pipes; but no Scotchman
even could pretend to delight in the shrill notes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cennamella</span></span>. The former at least of these two
popular instruments of southern Italy was well known
to the omniscient author of the Shakespearean plays,
for in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Othello</span></span> we have a direct allusion to the uncouth
braying music still made to-day by these outlandish
musicians.

In the midst of their instrumental duet the two
shaggy mountaineers are apt to break into a harsh
nasal hymn in honour of the Virgin, to visit whose
shrines at this season of the orange harvest is the main
object of their Christmas migration to the Neapolitan
shores. Very tastefully decorated are many of the
Madonna’s little sanctuaries in or near the orange
groves, when the arrival of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">zampognari</span></span> is considered
imminent. The tiny lamps are well trimmed and
shine brightly, whilst heavy garlands composed of
masses of bay or laurel or ilex leaves, interspersed
with some of the golden clusters of the ripening fruit
are suspended round the alcove that holds the figure
of the Virgin. This effective but simple form of
ornamentation will at once suggest the beautiful glazed
and coloured terra-cotta wreaths of fruit and foliage
that are to be seen so frequently in Tuscan churches;
indeed, it is possible that the members of the Della
Robbia family may have originally borrowed the
decorative schemes for their famous plaques and
lunettes from the rustic shrines thus simply but tastefully
embellished. Nominally, the two performers
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>are supposed to sing and make music on nine different
days at the houses of all their patrons in order to
make up the total number of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">novena</span></span>, but the
extent of their performances is generally calculated in
accordance with the depth of the householder’s purse,
the sum given for their services varying from a few
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">soldi</span></span> to a five <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lire</span></span> note. All classes of society employ
the zampognari, for it is with the first appearance of
the lovely golden fruit, essentially <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span></span> winter fruit of
the Italians, that the arrival of these picturesque
strangers has been associated from time immemorial.
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">zampognari</span></span> are in fact as much of a national
institution with the Neapolitans at Christmastide as
are the waits or carol-singers in our own country, so
that to the majority of these people <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Natale senza
zampogna e cennamella</span></span> would seem no true Christmas
at all.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Closely connected with the life of the people of the
Piano di Sorrento is the famous dance known as the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tarantella</span></span>, which may be witnessed by the curious at
almost any time—for money. Even when performed
by professional dancers, tricked out in spick and span
stage-peasant finery, the Tarantella is a most graceful
exhibition of movement, although the dance naturally
gains in interest when it takes place in the days of
vintage or on the popular festivals of the Church,
without the presence of largesse-giving strangers.
The origin of the name has always puzzled antiquarians,
although in all probability the dance derives its curious
appellation from the Greek city of Taranto, whence
the Tarentines introduced its steps and action into
other parts of Italy. But vulgar belief is very strong,
so that this graceful dance is still closely associated in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the popular mind with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tarantula</span></span>, a kind of
poisonous spider found in the neighbourhood of
Taranto, the effects of whose bite are said to yield to
violent exercise followed by profuse perspiration. In
order to excite the proper amount of exertion
necessary for the cure, the person afflicted, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">il tarantolato</span></span>,
is induced to leap and caper by the sound of music,
with the result that there exist a number of tunes
specially connected with this wild species of dancing.
The real explanation of this fable seems to lie in the
extremely excitable nature of the Tarentines themselves,
assisted by the exhilarating music and by frequent
pulls at the wine barrel. The two lines sung to the
air of one of the tunes employed:

</span></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
sums up pretty accurately the real cause of these
strange Tarentine orgies, which have really nothing
whatever in common with the rhythmical dance that is
still so popular in the environs of Naples. Nevertheless
the theory of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tarantella</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tarantismo</span></span> has been
gravely discussed by old Italian writers, and a certain
learned prelate of the fifteenth century, Niccolo
Perotto, Archbishop of Siponto, alludes to the
malignant cause of this dance-cure as <span class="tei tei-q">“a species of
speckled spider, dwelling in rents of the ground
caused by excessive heat. It was not known in the
time of our fore-fathers, but now it is very common
in Apulia ... and is generally called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tarantula</span></span>.
Its bite seldom kills a man, yet it makes him half
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>stupid, and affects him in a variety of ways. Some,
when a song or tune is heard, are so excited that
they dance, full of joy and always laughing, and do
not stop till they are entirely exhausted; others
spend a miserable life in tears, as if bewailing the
loss of friends. Some die laughing, and others in
tears.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such is the curious legend concerning the origin of
the Tarantella, which is still danced with something
of the old spirit by the holiday-making crowds of
Naples, though it is at the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">festa</span></span> of San Michele, the
patron of Procida, that the Tarantella can now be
seen to best advantage. Of the three islands that lie
close to Naples, Procida is the least known or visited
by strangers, so that when the Tarantella is danced by
the Procidani, the old-fashioned popular orchestra is
employed to give the necessary music. This consists
of five quaint instruments (obviously of Oriental origin
as their counterparts can still be seen amongst the
Kabyles of Northern Africa): the first being a fife
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">siscariello</span></span>); the second a tin globe covered with skin
pierced by a piece of cane (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">puti-puti</span></span>); the third a
wooden saw and a split stick, making a primitive bow
and fiddle (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">scetavaiasse</span></span>); the fourth an arrangement of
three wooden mallets, that are rattled together like a
gigantic pair of bones (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tricca-ballache</span></span>); and the fifth a
Jew’s harp (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">scaccia-pensieri</span></span>). A tarantella danced to
the accompaniment of so weird a medley of instruments
and by real peasants full of gaiety is naturally a
thing altogether diverse from the stilted, though graceful
and decorous performance that can be observed
any day for payment in a Sorrentine or Neapolitan
hotel; yet it must ever be borne in mind that the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Tarantella proper, whether danced <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">con amore</span></span> by Procidan
peasants or performed for lucre by costumed
professionals, is no vulgar frenzied <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">can-can</span></span>, but a
musical love-dance expressive of primitive courtship.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Tarantella is a choregraphic love-story, the

On a modest scale Sorrento can lay claim to be
called an eternal city, for the Surrentum of the ancient
Romans was a place of no small importance, filled with
villas of wealthy citizens and boasting a fair-sized
population, as its numerous remains of antiquity can
easily testify; whilst its crumbling ivy-clad walls and
towers point to its prosperity during the Middle Ages,
when Sorrento shared the political fortunes of Naples.
It is now a busy thriving little cathedral town, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the possessor of silk and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tarsia</span></span> work industries, so
that like Imperial Rome it can boast a continuous
existence as a city from remote times to the present
day. Its chief local Saint—for what Italian town
does not boast a special patron?—is Sant’ Antonio,
whose most famous feat is said to have been the
administering of a severe drubbing to Sicardo, Duke
of Benevento, for daring to interfere with the liberties
of his city in the ninth century. It would appear
from the legend that all arguments as to ancient
rights, the quality of mercy and the honour of keeping
faith having been vainly exhausted upon the cruel and
obstinate prince, Bishop Antonio came forward with
a stout cudgel and belaboured the tyrant in order to
obtain a favourable answer to the people’s petition.
The sanctity of the pugnacious prelate and the force
of this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">argumentum ad baculum</span></span> were evidently too
much for the Duke of Benevento, who at once conceded
the popular demands, whilst Antonio’s name has
deservedly descended to posterity as the capable protector
of his native city.

But the name which above all others Sorrento will
cherish as her own, <span class="tei tei-q">“so long as men shall read and
eyes can see,”</span> is that of the famous Italian poet, Torquato
Tasso, whose interesting but melancholy life-story
is closely associated with this, the town of his
birth. Tasso is reckoned as the fourth greatest bard
of Italy, ranking after Dante and Petrarch, and being
esteemed on a level with rather than below his rival
and contemporary, Ludovico Ariosto. In one sense
however he may be described as the most truly national
poet of this immortal quartet, for his career is
con<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>nected with his native country as a whole, rather than
with any one of the little cities or states then comprising
that <span class="tei tei-q">“geographical expression”</span> which is now
the Kingdom of Italy. His father’s family was
of Lombard origin, having been long settled in the
neighbourhood of Bergamo, where a crumbling hill-set
fortress known as the Montagno del Tasso still recalls
the name of the poet’s ancestors. His mother, Porzia
de’ Rossi, was Tuscan by birth, her family haling from
Pistoja at the foot of the Apennines, but owning property
near Naples; whilst the poet himself was
destined to spend his years of childhood at Sorrento
and at Naples, his youth at Rome and Verona, his
brilliant period of fame and prosperity at Ferrara and
the Lombard courts, and again some of his closing
years of disgrace and disappointment amidst the
familiar scenes of his infancy. Of good ancient stock
the Tassi owed their acquisition of wealth to the re-establishment
of the system of posting throughout Northern Italy in the
thirteenth century, when the immediate progenitor of the poet,
one Omodeo de’ Tassi, was nominated comptroller, and it is
curious to note that owing to this circumstance the arms of the
family containing the posthorn and the badger’s skin—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tasso</span></span>
is the Italian for badger—continued to be borne for
many centuries upon the harness of all
Lombard coach-horses. Torquato’s father, Bernardo
Tasso, himself a poet of no mean calibre and the
composer of a scholarly but somewhat prolix work, the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Amadigi</span></span>, formed for many years a prominent member
of that brilliant band of literary courtiers within the
castle of Vittoria Colonna, the Lady of Ischia, of whom
we shall speak more fully in another place. But for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the overwhelming and all-eclipsing fame of his distinguished
son, Bernardo might have been able to claim
a high place in the list of Italian writers of the
Renaissance; as it was, the father’s undoubted talents
were quickly forgotten in the blaze of his own beloved
<span class="tei tei-q">“Tassino’s”</span> popularity, so that he is now chiefly remembered
as the sire of a poetic genius, as one of <a name="corr241" id="corr241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">the</span>
great Vittoria’s favourite satellites and as the author
of an oft-quoted sonnet to his intellectual mistress.
Bernardo Tasso did not marry until the somewhat
mature age of forty-seven, when, as we have already
said, he espoused the daughter of the Tuscan house of
Rossi, by whom he had two children; a daughter,
Cornelia, and the immortal Torquato, who was born in
1544, three years before the death of the divine
poetess of Ischia.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Bernardo was not merely a bard and a courtier,
for he was also, unfortunately for himself and his ill-fated
family, a keen politician in an age when politics
offered anything but a safe pursuit, and as his views
invariably coincided with those of his chief friend and
patron, the head of the powerful Sanseverino family,
Tasso the Elder found himself in course of time an
exile from Neapolitan territory on account of his
dislike of the new Spanish masters of Naples. The
poet-politician therefore took up his abode at Rome,
whilst his wife and two young children continued to
reside at Naples and Sorrento. The boy was a born
student, almost an infant prodigy of learning, and so
great was his desire for knowledge that he would
insist upon rising long before it was day-light, and
would even make his way to school through the dark
dirty streets of Naples, conducted by a servant with a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>torch in his hand. The Jesuits, who had just set up
their first academy at Naples, soon discovered in the
future poet an ideal pupil, and not only did they impart
to the child all the lore of ancient Greece and
Rome, but they also imbued his mind, at an age when
it was <span class="tei tei-q">“wax to receive and marble to retain,”</span> with
their own peculiar theological tenets. It is obvious
indeed that the faith implanted by the Fathers in his
tender years was largely, if not wholly answerable for
the unswerving belief and firm religious convictions
that ever stood Tasso in good stead throughout the
whole of his chequered career. <span class="tei tei-q">“Give me a child of
seven years old,”</span> had once declared the great Founder
of the Society of Jesus, <span class="tei tei-q">“and I care not who has the
after-handling of him”</span>; and in this case the Jesuit
professors did not fail to carry out Loyola’s precept.
But his home life with his mother, whom he loved
devotedly, and his course of study at the Jesuit school
were suddenly interrupted when he was barely ten
years of age, for the elder Tasso was anxious for his
little son to join him in Rome, there to be educated
under his own eye. The boy left his mother, but
after his departure the Rossi family brutally refused
to allow their sister access to her absent husband,
who had lately been declared a rebel against the
Spanish government and deprived of his estates.
Thus persecuted by her unfeeling brothers, Porzia
Tasso sought refuge together with Cornelia in a
Neapolitan convent, where, deprived of her erratic but
beloved husband and pining for her absent son, the
poor woman died of a broken heart a year or two
later. As for Cornelia, she became affianced when
of a marriageable age to a gentleman of Sorrento,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the Cavaliere Marzio Sersale, and consequently
returned to live in the home of her childhood.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of Tasso’s many adventures, of his universal literary
fame, of the honours heaped upon him by his chief
patron, Duke Alfonso of Ferrara, and of his subsequent
disgrace and imprisonment for daring to lift his eyes
in love to a princess of the haughty House of Este,
we have no space to speak here. Let it suffice to say
that he was one of the most charming, virtuous,
brilliant, manly figures, as he was also almost the last
true representative, of the great Italian Renaissance,
the end of which may be described as coinciding with
his decease. According to his biographer Manso, the
author of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gerusalemme Liberata</span></span> was singularly
noble and refined in appearance, though always
possessed of an air of melancholy; he was well-built,
strong, active and resourceful, anything in fact but a
carpet-knight who spent his days in writing verse and
dallying with Italian court beauties:

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
sang the populace of Ferrara in honour of their
illustrious Sorrentine guest, for the Ferrarese delighted
in the handsome stranger who could in an emergency
wield the sword as skilfully as he could ply his
quill. Twice only however did Tasso revisit the city
of his birth, and each return home was occasioned
by deep tragedy. In 1577, wounded by the attacks
of his literary rivals and humiliated by the Duke
Alfonso’s discovery of his infatuation for the Princess
Leonora d’Este, the unhappy poet travelled southward,
reaching Sorrento in the disguise of a shepherd.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Making his way to the Casa Sersale, the house of his
sister, now a widow with two sons, Torquato passed
himself off as his own messenger, and so eloquently
did he relate the story of his own grief and wrongs,
that the tender-hearted Cornelia fainted away at this
recital. Having satisfied his mind as to his sister’s
genuine affection, the pseudo-shepherd now revealed
his true character, whereupon the pair embraced with
transports of joy, though it was deemed prudent not
to acquaint their friends with the arrival of Torquato,
who was represented to the good people of Sorrento
as a distant relative from Bergamo. Cornelia Sersale
now entreated the poet to take up his abode permanently
in her house, and to forget the rebuffs of
the cruel world without in the enjoyment of family
ties and affections; and well would it have been for
Torquato, had he accepted his sister’s advice and
passed the succeeding years in simple rural pleasures.
But restless and inconsequent despite all his virtues,
the poet must needs return to Ferrara to bask in the
presence of his beloved Leonora, with the dire and
undignified result that all the world knows. Tasso’s
second visit took place not long before his death,
when his strength was rapidly failing, so that it seems
strange that he did not decide to end his days amidst
these lovely and well-remembered scenes of his early
boyhood, instead of deliberately choosing for the last
stage of his earthly journey the Roman convent of
Sant’ Onofrio, where the death-chamber and various
pathetic relics of the poet are still pointed out.

account of the First Crusade and constitutes an
apotheosis of Godfrey de Bouillon, first Christian King
of Jerusalem; but it is also something more than a
mere poetical description of a departed age of chivalry.
For there can be little doubt that the poet aspired to
be the singer of a new movement which should wrest
back the Holy City from the clutches of the Saracens,
and set a second Godfrey upon the vacant throne of
Palestine. To this important end the experiences of
his infancy and his training by the Jesuits had undoubtedly
tended to urge the precocious young poet.
The servants of his father’s house at Sorrento must
many a time have regaled his eager boyish mind with
harrowing tales of the infidel pirates who scoured the
Tyrrhene Sea within sight of the watch-towers on the
coast; within ken, perchance, of Casa Tasso itself, perched
on the commanding cliff above the waters. Scarcely
a family dwelling on the Marina below but was mourning
one or more of its members that had been seized
by the blood-thirsty marauders, perhaps to be brutally
slain on the spot or to languish in the dungeons of
Tripoli and Smyrna, eking out a life of slavery that
was far worse than death itself. Stories of tortured
Christians, like that of the pious Geronimo of Algiers
who was tied with cords and flung into a mass of soft
concrete, were common enough topics among the
Sorrentine folk, all of whom lived in constant dread
of a successful raid by the Barbary pirates. For,
despite the efforts of the great Emperor Charles the
Fifth to protect his maritime subjects, the swift galleys
of Tunis and Tripoli out-stripped the Imperial men-of-war,
and continued to carry on their vile commerce
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of slavery. Such a state of terrorism must have
appeared intolerable to the highly romantic, deeply
religious spirit of the young poet; and his Jesuit
preceptors, working on the boy’s imagination, were
soon able to instil into his youthful brain the notion
of a new Crusade which would not only sweep the
infidel ships from off the Italian seas, but would also recapture
the Holy City itself. The Church, beginning
at last to recover from the effects of Luther’s schism,
was once more in a position to re-assert its ancient
authority over Catholic Christendom, and in Torquato
Tasso it found an able trumpeter to call together the
scattered forces of the Faithful, and to reunite them
in a holy war. Astonished and delighted, all Italy
was swept by the golden torrent of Tasso’s impassioned
verses, that were intended to urge the Catholic princes
of Europe to the inauguration of a new Crusade. Nor
were the times unpropitious for such an event. Tunis,
that hot-bed of infidelity, piracy and iniquity, was in
the hands of the Christians; and the fleets of the
Soldan had been well-nigh annihilated by Don John
of Austria at the glorious battle of Lepanto:—to
convince a doubting and hesitating world that the
actual moment had come wherein to recover the city
of Jerusalem was the main object of the author of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gerusalemme Liberata</span></span>. And it was his infancy
spent upon this smiling but pirate-harassed coast that
was chiefly responsible for this desired end in the epic
of the Crusades; it was Tasso’s early acquaintance
with the Bay of Naples, combined with his special
training by the Jesuits, that forced the poet’s genius
and ambition into this particular channel.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is pleasant to think that Sorrento is still
appre<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ciative of its honour as the birth-place of the great
Italian poet. The citizens have erected a statue of
marble in one of their open spaces; they have called
street, hotel and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">trattoria</span></span> by his illustrious name; and
can the modern spirit of grateful acknowledgment go
further than this? His father’s house has perished, it
is true, through <span class="tei tei-q">“Nature’s changing force untrimmed,”</span>
for the greedy waves have undermined and swallowed
up the tufa cliff which once supported the old Tasso
villa. But there is still standing in Strada di San
Nicola the old Sersale mansion, wherein the good
Cornelia received her long-lost brother in his peasant’s
guise, an unhappy exile from haughty Ferrara. Of
more interest however than the old town house of the
Sersale family is the ancient farm, known as the Vigna
Sersale, which once belonged to Donna Cornelia, and
supplied her household with wine and oil. It is a
lovely sequestered spot lying on the breezy hill-side
not far down the Massa road, facing towards Capri
and the sunset. Hallowed by its historic connection
with the poet and his devoted sister, the Vigna Sersale
can claim perhaps to be one of the most interesting
and beautiful places of literary pilgrimage upon earth.
Ascending by the steep pathway that leads upward
from the broad high road, it is not long before we
reach the old <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">podere</span></span>, amidst whose olive groves and
vineyards the poet was wont to sit dreamily gazing at
the glorious view before him. Here are the same
ancient spreading stone-pines, the same gnarled olive
trees that sheltered the gentle love-lorn poet, whilst
Cornelia and her sons sate beside him in the shade,
endeavouring—alas! only too vainly—by their caresses
to detain the roving Torquato in their midst. Could
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>not, we ask ourselves, the erratic poet have been content
to remain in this spot, <span class="tei tei-q">“in questa terra alma e
felice”</span> as he himself styles it, instead of plunging once
more into the dangers and dissipation of that Vanity
Fair of distant Ferrara? Why could he not have
brooded over his ill-starred infatuation for the high-born
Leonora in this soothing corner of the earth,
allowing its quiet and beauty to sink into his soul,
until the recollection of his Innamorata declined
gradually into a fragrant memory that could be
embalmed in never-dying verse? But like his own
favourite hero, the Christian King of Jerusalem, the
poet must in his inmost heart have preferred a
changing storm-tossed life to the ideal existence of
rustic ease; and had he not returned to the treacherous
splendours of Alfonso’s court, how much less
entrancing would his own life-story have appeared to
after ages! Unconsciously he seems to have composed
his own epitaph in describing Godfrey’s death;
for the crusading king lived and died like a true
Christian knight, for whom the world has afforded
many adventures, and but few intervals of peace until
the final call to endless rest.

Lying between the classic capes of Misenum
and Minerva, the island of Capri appears like
a couched lion, guarding the entrance of the Bay
of Naples; his majestic head being formed by the
stupendous cliffs of the Salto that face the sunrise,
whilst his back and loins are represented by the long
broad slope which stretches from the summit of
Monte Solaro to the most westerly headland of
Vitareta. Nor is it only as a guardian to their
Bay that Capri serves the Neapolitans, for it also
presents them with a gigantic natural barometer.
In fine settled weather a soft haze invariably lies
over the sea, so that Capri is only faintly visible
from the shores of Parthenope, save at sunrise and
sunset, when for a short time the graceful form
of the islet looms out clear-cut like a jagged amethyst
upon a sapphire bed; but before rain or storm
it yields up its inmost secrets to the public gaze
of Naples. The northern Marina, the towns of
Capri and Ana-Capri, even the little terraced fields
become discernible to the naked eye: <span class="tei tei-q">“It will
be wet to-morrow”</span> augur the weather-wise of Naples,
and the prediction is rarely falsified.

between Naples and Capri, putting in at Sorrento on
its journeys backwards and forwards, or—far pleasanter
if somewhat slower way—by engaging a boat with
four rowers, who on a calm day ought to make the
Marina of Capri in less than two hours. Nothing
can be more delightful or exhilarating than this old-fashioned
method of transit; and it gives also a

crammed with tourists and attendant touts. It is

Bending with a will to their oars, our genial
mariners quickly impel our barque round the first
jutting headland, so that the thickly populated
Piano di Sorrento is at once lost to view. Making
good headway over the clear water, it is not long
before we find ourselves passing beneath the wave-washed
precipices of the Salto, and well within our
time limit of two hours we reach the roadstead of
the Marina, to find ourselves in a bright and busy
world of traffic and pleasure. Between the houses
coloured coral-pink, white, blue, and yellow, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the pale green transparent water lies a long stretch of
beach covered with every sort of craft that sails the
Mediterranean, and with a motley crowd of fishermen,
tourists and noisy children; whilst the whole
atmosphere rings with raucous voices raised in
giving directions, in quarrelling, or in addressing
the many perplexed strangers. We disembark, and
cross the intervening beach with its sea-weed veiled
boulders and masses of tawny fishing nets; we reach
the village, and here we meet with our first disappointment
in romantic Capri. It was not so very many
years ago, barely thirty in point of fact, that this
island was roadless, and in those primitive days the
visitor was met at the Marina Grande by tall
strapping Capriote women, who were wont to seize
the traveller’s pieces of baggage as though they had
been light parcels, and to march up the old stone
staircase poising these burdens on their heads with
the carriage of an empress. The stranger’s own
entrance into Capri was less dignified, for either he
had to toil painfully in the blazing sun up that
steep picturesque flight of steps and reach the plateau
above, perspiring and probably out of temper; or else
he was compelled to bestride a miserable ass which a
bare-footed damsel steered upward by means of the
quadruped’s tail. Nowadays, we are spared this
original and somewhat humiliating manner of arrival
at our journey’s end. There are little <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">carrozzelle</span></span>,
drawn by clever black Abruzzi cobs awaiting us,
and even one or two hotel conveyances. We find
ourselves being driven rapidly up the excellent
winding road constructed only a quarter of a century
ago, past the domed Church of San Costanzo, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>patron Saint of the Caprioti, past hedges of aloe and
prickly pear, until we gain the saddle of the island-mountain,
where stands the small capital perched
upon a ledge that overlooks the Bay of Naples to the
north, and to the south the endless expanse of the
unruffled Tyrrhene.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is evident even to the most casual untrained eye,
that this huge mass of sea-girt rock whereon we stand
must in remote ages have formed part of the mainland
opposite, until some fierce convulsion of nature,
common enough in this region that is ever changing its
outward face through subterranean forces, tore what is
now Capri asunder from the Punta della Campanella,
and placed the sea as an eternal barrier between the
riven headlands of continent and new-formed island.
The charm of this rocky fragment, thus placed in mid
ocean by volcanic action, was first discovered by the
great Emperor Augustus, who chancing to visit the
island for some obscure reason was greatly affected by
the spectacle of a withered ilex tree, that revived and
burst into foliage at the auspicious moment of his
setting foot at the Marina. Flattered at the compliment
paid by Nature’s self to his august presence and
drawing a happy omen from the incident, the Emperor
at once proposed to the people of Neapolis, who then
owned the island, that they should exchange barren
Capreae for the larger and more fertile imperial
appanage of Aenaria (Ischia)—a bargain to which the
shrewd Neapolitans readily agreed. Here then in a
spot at once so salubrious and so convenient for
the management of affairs of state, the Emperor sought
rest and relaxation at such times as he could escape
the cares of government. At his bidding villas and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pleasaunces were constructed; roads were carried by
means of viaducts across the airy plateau lying between
the Salto and the Solaro; and the able bodied inhabitants
of the island were enrolled as a sort of
honorary bodyguard for the person of Augustus during
his occasional visits. In this secluded, yet accessible
retreat, the ruler of the Roman world could easily lay
his finger, as it were, upon the beating pulse of his
mighty empire, for Capreae was at no great distance
from Rome itself, and from the heights of the island
note could be made of the movements of the Imperial
fleet lying at Baiae or of the arrival of the corn ships
from Egypt and Asia Minor. But the name of the
good Augustus is scarcely remembered in connection
with Capreae, which alone recalls its association with
Tiberius the Tyrant, who spent the last nine years
of his reign upon the rocky islet that was so beloved
of his predecessor. To this spot <span class="tei tei-q">“Timberio”</span> (as the
natives invariably misname the Emperor) feeling the
rapid approach of senile decay, weary of the thankless
task of ruling an ungrateful people, sick of family dissensions
and of court intrigue, at last came in the
cherished hope of spending the few remaining years of
his life in cultured leisure and in comparative solitude.
An enthusiastic student of astronomy and of its sister
science, or rather pseudo-science, astrology, Tiberius
proposed to study the heavens in the company of
chosen mathematicians and soothsayers. Twelve
buildings—palaces, villas, pavilions, call them what
you will—were now constructed for the special examination
of the planets, and in consequence the whole
of the island, whose limited area after all is exceeded
by many an English park, was practically turned into
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>one vast maritime residence, for all the Imperial
pleasure-houses seem to have been connected with each
other by means of viaducts or secret stair-ways. Yet
whilst immersed in astronomy and occultism, the aged
Emperor contrived to find time for the routine of
public business, and, like Augustus, he was still able
to direct from his rocky retreat the policy of the
Empire. The reports of governors of provinces, for
example, were received, read, and commented upon by
Tiberius in his Capriote home, and amongst these
there must have been included a certain official
document from one Pontius Pilatus, Procurator of
Judaea, relating how a Jewish prophet from Nazareth
had been condemned, scourged and crucified by his
orders at the special request of the Jews themselves.
How eloquent is this bald statement of a simple fact,
that here in this tiny barren islet was brought the
casual news of the death of Jesus Christ to the then
ruler of the Roman world! Surely an historical
incident such as this is of more value than all the
hazy legends or pointless miracles of St Januarius or
of San Costanzo, upon which the imagination of the
islanders has been fed for generations.

Remnants of Tiberius’ palaces, all of which are said
to have been razed to the ground by order of the
Roman Senate at his death, are scattered thick as
fallen leaves in Vallombrosa over the whole surface of
the island, and it is to the ruins of the Villa Jovis at
its eastern crest that the visitor will in all probability
first direct his steps. The way thither from the little
city of Capri leads through narrow lanes along a stony
but populous hill-side, to which the flat-roofed dazzling
white houses with their small iron-barred windows lend
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>an oriental aspect; an illusion that is aided by the
appearance of an occasional date-palm over-topping
some low wall, and by clumps or hedges of the prickly
pear. This latter plant, of Indian extraction as its
name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ficus Indica</span></span> betrays, grows in profusion over
the sun-baked rocky slopes of southern Italy, especially
in the neighbourhood of the sea. The peasants find
it most useful, for it makes impenetrable hedges, and
its coarse pulpy leaves when pounded up afford good
provender for their goats and donkeys. The fruits of
the prickly pear, those quaint crimson or yellow knobs
attached to the edges of the leaves, are likewise
gathered and eaten by the people, or else cleaned of
their protecting layers of spiny hairs and despatched
in baskets to Naples, where the cactus-fruit forms an
important item of the popular fare. The fruit itself
has a lovely colour and a fragrant scent, which give
promise of a better flavour than it actually possesses,
for it is hopelessly insipid to the taste, although the
Neapolitans declare that the pulp, when mashed up
into patties and iced, is very palatable.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A long up-hill ramble over rough paths leads eventually
to the Villa of Jupiter, perched on the Salto—the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saltus Caprearum</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Wild Goats’ Leap,”</span> of the
ancients. There is little of interest to be seen in the
existing portions of Tiberius’ chief villa, for the building
has been despoiled centuries ago of its rich marbles,
its slabs of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">giallo</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">verde antico</span></span>, its pillars of red
porphyry and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">serpentino</span></span>, some fragments of which may
be found imbedded in the pavement of the mosque-like
little Duomo of Capri. But it is evident from the
immense extent of its substructures, now used for
humble enough purposes, that the Villa Jovis must
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>have been a palace of remarkable size. A hermit who
offers sour wine, a fat middle-aged woman, a figure of
fun in her gay be-ribboned dress who begins languidly
dancing a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tarantella</span></span>, and a vulgar pestilent guide who
produces a spy-glass usually haunt these caverns on the
look-out for any chance visitor. Buy them off, O stranger!
with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">soldi</span></span>, is our advice, for you cannot otherwise
escape their importunities, and then mounting
to the highest point, peer down into the clear depths
of the water nearly a thousand feet below. For it
was here, if we can credit serious Roman historians,
that the Imperial tyrant, half crazy with terror and
ever thirsting for human blood, was wont to hurl the
objects of his hate into the sea; <span class="tei tei-q">“from this eminence,”</span>
Suetonius gravely tells us, <span class="tei tei-q">“after the application of
long drawn-out and exquisite tortures, Tiberius used to
order his executioners to fling their victims before his
eyes into the water, where boats full of mariners,
stationed below, were waiting in readiness to beat the
bruised bodies with oars, in case any spark of life might
yet be left in them.”</span> The terrible legend fits in aptly
with the appearance of this forbidding dizzy precipice,
especially on a dark stormy afternoon, when the dull
roar of the waves dashing against the cliffs below,
mounts upward to the Villa Jovis like the angry bellowing
of some insatiable sea-monster.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was whilst brooding here after the death of
Sejanus in Rome, that the Emperor, not daring to
move beyond the walls of his palace, shunning the
society of all save his familiar friends and attendants,
and with his face disfigured by an eruption of the
skin of which he was painfully sensitive, that there
took place an incident (which may or may not be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>true) mentioned by Suetonius. In the privacy of
this villa Tiberius was one day surprised by an
ingenious Capriote fisherman, who in ignorance or
defiance of the Emperor’s wishes had managed to
scale with his naked feet the steep cliffs from the
sea below, in order to present a fine mullet for the
imperial table, and of course to earn a high reward
for his <span class="tei tei-q">“gift.”</span> Terrified at the mere notion of anybody
being able thus to penetrate into his most
secret domain, the irate Emperor at once gave orders
for the intruder’s face to be scrubbed with the mullet
he had brought, a sentence that the imperial minions
performed without delay. The intrepid fisherman
might have congratulated himself on so mild a
punishment for having disturbed a tyrant’s repose, had
he not been possessed of an unusually strong sense
of humour. For at the close of the mullet-scrubbing
episode, the foolish fellow remarked by way of a
jest to the officer on duty, that he was thankful he
had not also offered the emperor a large crab
which he had likewise brought in his basket. This
imprudent speech was immediately reported to
Tiberius, who thereupon commanded the man’s face
to be lacerated with the aforesaid crab’s claws; but
whether this pleasing incident ended with a cold
plunge from the Salto, the Roman historian does not
relate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Other tales of Timberio’s vices and cruelties have
been handed down from generation to generation, so
that the dark deeds committed at the Salto have almost
passed into a local article of faith; and such being
the case, it would seem almost a pity to pronounce
these picturesque horrors untrue or exaggerated.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Nevertheless, of recent years there has arisen amongst
scholars a certain degree of scepticism as regards
these highly coloured anecdotes of Roman historians
known to be prejudiced. The Emperor was nearly
seventy years old at the time he came to reside in
Capreae, and until that date his life had been orderly
and above reproach; it is not likely therefore, argue
these modern writers, that Tiberius should suddenly,
at so extreme an age, have flung himself into a whirl
of vices and crimes that he had hitherto shunned.
The thing is of course possible, but it sounds improbable.
That he was moody and morose; that he loved solitude and
hated formal society in the spot he had especially chosen
as the retreat of his declining years; that he practised
certain of the mystic arts, as well as studied astronomy,
are all likely enough conjectures; and these circumstances
probably formed the foundation for the extravagant legends which
now surround the Emperor’s memory. Very shocking
and reprehensible were the doings at Villa Jovis, if

If, despite the negative theories held to-day concerning
the private life and character of the second
Emperor of Rome during his residence on Capreae,
the traveller be still inclined to trace the sites of
the remaining eleven Imperial villas, he will find little
difficulty in meeting with numberless Roman remains
scattered over all parts of the island. On the beach,
for example, a little to the west of the Marina Grande,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>are clearly visible the sunken foundations of the
great sea-palace, which in the Roman manner jutted
into the water and ranked probably second in size to
the Villa Jovis. The neighbourhood of Ana-Capri
also, and in fact the whole western portion of the
island, is likewise plentifully besprinkled with ancient
ruins, one of which is still known by the suggestive
title of Timberino. But most people will prefer to
explore the unrivalled natural beauties of Capri, rather
than to make themselves acquainted with its archaeological
points of interest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First and foremost of the many wonders that Capri has to
show must be ranked the Grotta Azzurra. The pleasantest
way of reaching this world-famous cavern is by small boat
from the Marina, rather than by the daily steamer from Naples;
and a perfectly calm and bright morning must be selected for
the expedition, for if the surface of the sea appears in the
least degree ruffled by northerly winds, it becomes
impossible for any craft to make the low entrance of
the grotto. Capriote boatmen are as a rule intelligent
and pleasant to deal with, and not a few of the
denizens of the Marina own to some knowledge of
English, or rather of American, since several of the
inhabitants are the sons of emigrants who have
settled in the cities of the United States or the
Argentine, but whose love for their island home is
still so strong that they contrive to send their children
back to Capri, in order that they may retain their
Italian citizenship and be ready to serve their expected
term of years in the Army.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Past the gay-coloured shipping of the noisy Marina,
past the wave-washed halls of Tiberius’ <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">palazzo a mare</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>our boat swiftly glides over the pellucid expanse until
it reaches those vast towering cliffs of limestone that
spring almost perpendicular from the waters’ edge to
the plateau of Ana-Capri, fully a thousand feet above
our heads. Clumps of palmetto, of cytizus, and of
various hardy shrubs manage to sprout and to exist in
the crannies of this sheer wall of rock; and on some
of the larger ledges, far out of reach of a despoiling
human hand, we see masses of the odorous narcissus,
though whence they draw their sustenance it is hard
to tell. At length we reach the entrance of the
Grotto, and here, at a signal from our boatman, we
crouch down low in the body of the boat, whilst our
rower, skilfully taking advantage of a gentle surging
wave, guides our craft with his hands through an
opening in the sheer wall, so low that the gunwales
grate against the rocky surface of the natural arch.
At once we find ourselves in a scene of mystical
beauty, in an extravagant voluptuous dream of loveliness,
such as the Arabian Nights alone could dare to
suggest. Above us, around us, behind us, before us
lies a luminous azure atmosphere, which produces the
effect of a gigantic molten sapphire, whose secret blue
fires we have actually tracked to their lurking-place in
the very heart of the gem. Against the all-pervading
shimmering light our own forms stand out distinct of
an intense and velvety blackness, yet the blades of the
oars that cleave the melted sapphire of the water, the
tips of our fingers that dabble in the celestial liquid,
appear as if coated with tiny globules of silver. Our
boatman’s son, a picturesque lad of fifteen or there-abouts,
has, we notice, been engaged in hastily casting
off his scanty attire; for a moment his slight graceful
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>figure is outlined against the blue light like some antique
bronze of Pompeii or Herculaneum, and then there is
a splash as the youthful form, diving into the pool, is
instantaneously changed by the genius of the place
into a silver-glistening sea-god, the very image of the
fisherman Glaucus sung of old by Ovid, who became
an Immortal and dwelt ever afterwards, according to
the ancient myth, in an azure palace beneath the sea.
As the stripling rises to the surface all glittering to
breathe the air, his head turns from frosted silver to
ebon blackness, as does likewise his hand, raised from
the water to clasp the boat’s prow. Slowly we are
propelled round the lofty domed cavern, and are shown
the little beach at its further extremity with its
mysterious and unexplored flight of stone steps, down
which, so our mariner informs us, the wicked Timberio
used to descend from his villa at Damecuta, hundreds
of feet overhead, to take a plunge in these enchanted
waters. The Emperor and his friends may or may
not have gambolled in this jewelled bath; but certain
it is that Tiberius knew of the existence of this unique
cavern; and equally certain that an artistic but
demented potentate of our own days was so smitten
with the idea of owning a secret staircase descending
to a blue grotto, that he must needs construct within
the walls of a fantastic castle in the highlands of
Bavaria an artificial counterpart of the Grotta Azzurra,
with metal swans moved by clockwork swimming
thereon!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our genial boatman beguiles the time of our returning
by a long story, told him in his boyhood by his
old grandfather, of how two English <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Signori</span></span> had
managed to rediscover the entrance to the Blue
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Grotto, which had been lost since the days of the
Emperor Timberio, and how in expectation of the
Englishmen’s reward a plucky sailor, named Ferrara,
had made his way all round the island in a cask,
trying to force an entrance into every possible cavern,
until at last he hit upon the mouth of the Grotta
Azzurra itself, and thus gained the prize. But as a
matter of fact the existence of the Grotto was never
wholly forgotten, for its beauties were certainly known
to the old Italian chronicler Capaccio. Yet doubtless
during the long period of the Napoleonic wars, when
Capri from its strategic position became a choice
bone of contention between French, English and
Neapolitan forces, there were few if any persons who
possessed the courage or curiosity to visit the cavern;
with the result that its <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">exact</span></span> locality became temporarily
lost. It was known, however, to exist somewhere at
the base of the great northern cliff, so that only a very
small portion of the coast-line had to be explored,
before its tiny inconspicuous entrance could be rediscovered.
A far more exciting event than the refinding
of the Blue Grotto was the genuine discovery
of the beautiful Grotta Verde on the southern side of
the island by two Englishmen, Mr Reid and Mr
Lacaita, in the summer of 1848. This grotto,
esteemed the second in importance of the many caves
that Capri boasts, consists of a huge natural archway
formed in the cliffs wherein the water and rocks appear
of an emerald hue, contrasting strangely with the
opaque blue of the sea beyond, and suggesting in its
dual colouring the marvellous combination of dark
blue and iridescent green in the peacock’s tail.

the wearer to follow with greater ease the rough stony
tracks, often at a dizzy height above the sea, that form

foreign residents upon the island. There are some
delightfully peaceful nooks to be sought near the water’s
edge, not far from the Faraglioni, that picturesque trio
of rocks lying off the south-eastern corner of Capri.
Here we can find a sheltered corner, unfrequented
alike by the pestering native or by the ubiquitous
tourist; perchance the deserted hall of some maritime
villa, for the caverns near the Piccola Marina abound
in traces of Roman architecture. In such a retreat,

But to those who prefer to take long tramps afield
rather than to linger in meditation on the sunny
beaches near the Piccola Marina, there is always the
ascent to Ana-Capri by the broad smooth winding road
that affords a fresh view of the Bay of Naples at every
one of its many twists and turnings. Over a ravine
filled with masses of ilex and myrtle; past the fragment
of the pirate Barbarossa’s aerial castle, perched on a
rocky pinnacle and looking like some fantastic creation
of Gustave Doré’s brush; the broad ribband of road
leads across the steep northern flank of Monte Solaro,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>until it ends at Ana-Capri with its white houses nestling
round a domed church. It is an easy ascent, taking
no great space of time, yet strange to relate, well within
living memory the only approach to this hill-set village
was by means of the interminable stone staircase with
some five hundred steps that connected it with the
Marina Grande below. A charming writer on Neapolitan
life and character thus shrewdly sums up the
general opinion concerning this altered aspect of
conditions with regard to Ana-Capri, now brought at
last into close touch with modern civilization and its
accruing benefits:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Before the culminating point is reached, the road
crosses the old staircase, which has unfortunately been
almost completely destroyed by the huge masses of
rock dislodged from the cliff above by the workmen.
It makes one sad to look at it, and almost regret
that the new road ever was constructed. Were every
invective that has been vented on those same steps
turned into a paving-stone, there would be more than
sufficient to pave the streets of Naples anew; were
every drop of sweat that has fallen upon them collected,
there would be enough water to flood them. And yet
now that this dreadful staircase has been superseded
by a good macadamised road, every one seems to regret
the change. Says the heavily laden <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">contadina</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">‘The
old way was the shortest;’</span> says the artist: <span class="tei tei-q">‘It was
infinitely more picturesque; that new parapet wall is
a dreadful eye-sore;’</span> says the archaeologist: <span class="tei tei-q">‘It had
the merit of antiquity; it is not everywhere that one
can tread in the footprints of a hundred generations.’</span>
Even those whose every step in the olden time was
accompanied by a malediction, can remember how
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>good a glass of very inferior wine tasted on reaching
Ana-Capri.”</span><a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But whether Ana-Capri has or has not been really
benefited by the Italian Government’s finely engineered
road, there can be no doubt that the
primitive charm of the island, which in by-gone days
constituted one of its chief attractions, has greatly
declined with the wholesale introduction of modern
conventions and improvements. With the sudden
influx of wealthy strangers, Anglo-Saxon, German,
French and Russian, it is not surprising to learn that
the islanders have become somewhat demoralized
under the changed conditions of life, and that not a
small proportion of them have grown venal and grasping.
The happy old days when artists and inn-keepers,
peasants and such chance visitors as loved the simple
unsophisticated life, hob-nobbed together on terms of
equality are gone for ever. Fashion, that merciless
deity, has annexed the Insula Caprearum to her ever-growing
dominions;—there are smart villas on the
Tragara road and even at Ana-Capri; there are
British tea-rooms and Teutonic <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bierhälle</span></span> in the town.
At the present time the tourists and foreign residents
form the chief source of wealth to the islanders, now
that the quails have more or less deserted these shores.
Instead of awaiting in due season with nets ready
prepared the advent of the plump little feathered
immigrants from the African coast, the modern
Caprioti are continually on the look-out for the
steamers that bear hundreds of money-spending
tourists to the Marina, and these they proceed to
enmesh with proffered offers of service. And,
speak<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ing of the quails, in the days before breech-loading
guns and reckless extermination had injured this
valuable source of revenue, the arrival of the birds
winging their way northward was the signal for every
sportsman on the island to hasten to collect the annual
harvest of game. High poles, supporting nets twenty
feet broad and sixty feet long, were erected on the
grassy slopes of the Solaro or in the plateau of the
Tragara, towards which, by dint of judicious scaring
and shouting from expectant watchers stationed at
various points, the flight of the on-rushing birds was
directed. Dashing themselves with force against this
wall of netting, the poor quails fell stunned to the
ground, where they were easily taken by hand, whilst
scores of guns were levelled ready to bring down such
birds as had escaped the snare prepared for them.
From the thousands of quails thus captured the
islanders were enabled to pay their taxes to the
Bourbon Government, as well as to provide the income
of their Bishop—for in those distant days a prelate
dwelt at Capri—who in allusion to his chief source of
income was jocularly known at the Roman court as
<span class="tei tei-q">“Il Vescovo delle Quaglie.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From Ana-Capri to the western shore extends the
most fertile stretch of land in the island: a broad
slope set with vineyards and groves of silver-grey
olives, that are interspersed here and there with clumps
of almond and plum trees. Fine oil is yielded by the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">poderi</span></span> of Ana-Capri and Damecuta, whilst the grapes
produce the highly prized red and white Capri vintages,
choice wine of which the casual traveller rarely tastes
a good sample, for it is usually doctored and <span class="tei tei-q">“improved”</span>
for purposes of keeping by the wine-merchants
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of Naples. Thus the rasping red liquid that appears
on the table of a London restaurant, and the scented
strong-tasting white stuff that is sold in the hotels of
the island itself or of Naples under the name of Capri,
have little in common with the pure unadulterated
product of these sunny breezy vineyards. But besides
wine and oil, the island is likewise celebrated for its
beautiful and varied flora, and it is amongst the olive
groves and lanes of the western side of the island that
the wild flowers can be found in the greatest profusion.
Amongst the tender green shoots of the young springing
corn are set myriads of brilliant hued
anemones, purple, scarlet, and white with a crimson
centre; and even in January can be found in warm
sheltered nooks the pretty mauve wind-flower, one of
the earliest of spring blossoms in Italy. The grassy
pathways that intersect the various holdings are gay
with rosy-tipped daisies, white <span class="tei tei-q">“star-of-Bethlehem,”</span>
dark purple grape-hyacinth, and the tiny strong-scented
marigold, that seems to bloom the whole twelve-month
round. Amongst the loose stone-work of the
walled lanes, where beryl-backed lizards peep in and
out of every crevice, can be found fragrant violets and
the delicate fumitory with its pink waxy bells. In
moist places flourish patches of the wild arum or of
the stately great celandine, the <span class="tei tei-q">“swallow-wort”</span> of
old-fashioned herbalists, who believed that the swallow
made use of the thick yellow juice that runs in the
veins of this plant to anoint the eyes of her fledgelings!
And with the disappearance of the anemones
as the season advances, their place is taken by blood-red
poppies, by golden hawkweeds and by masses of
tall magenta-coloured blooms of the wild gladiolus, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“Jacob’s Ladder”</span> of our own English gardens.
Strange enough amongst these familiar homely flowers
appear the sub-tropical clumps of prickly pear, and
the hedges of aloe which here and there have thrown
up a gigantic spike of blossom eight or ten feet in
height, a triumphal favour of Nature that the plant
itself must pay for by its subsequent death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From Ana-Capri we ascend to the peak of the lofty
Solaro, by no means an arduous climb from this point,
for we have but to follow a narrow goat-track leading
across slopes covered with coarse grass and some low
thickets of stunted lentisk and myrtle. The rosemary
too grows plentifully on the dry wind-swept soil,
and the soft sea breeze wafts its refreshing scent to
our nostrils. There is a pretty legend of the people
which relates the cause of this plant obtaining its
perfume of unearthly sweetness:—how the Madonna
one day hung the swaddling clothes of the Infant
Christ to dry upon a common pot-herb in the
garden at Nazareth—the rosemary is freely used in
Italian cookery, and its taste is as unpleasant as its
scent is delicious—whereupon the humble plant thus
honoured was ever afterwards endowed with the delicate
odour that is so highly prized. And beyond this, the
rosemary was likewise permitted to put forth masses of
flowers of the Madonna’s own colour of blue, concerning
which a tradition—Celtic, not Italian—avers that on
Christmas morning upon every plant of rosemary will
be found by those who care to seek them expanded
blooms in honour of St Joseph, the Virgin and the
Holy Child. Reaching the crest of the Solaro, we are
well rewarded for our climb over the stony slopes by a
wide-spreading view. Owing to the central position
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the island, we can from its airy summit, some
sixteen hundred feet above sea-level, command a
glorious panorama of the three bays of the Neapolitan
Riviera, each teeming with a thousand associations of
classical or modern history. Upon those dancing
waters of the Bay of Naples appeared in the dim ages
of the heroic world the Trojan galleys that were bearing
the founder of the Roman race towards the beach
by Cumae yonder, where dwelt the venerable Sibyl;
the fleets of ancient Rome and Carthage, the war-ships
of the great Emperor Charles V., the pirate galleys of
the Soldan’s vassals, the men-of-war of Nelson have
all rode and fought upon the bosom of the bay beneath
us. What a marvellous perspective of the whole naval
history of the Mediterranean does a survey of the Bay
of Naples suggest!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Exquisite and inspiring as is the view on a clear
cloudless day, with the keen <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tramontana</span></span> off the distant
Abruzzi flecking the azure waves with streaks of
creamy foam and driving the white-sailed feluccas
merrily towards the open sea, the landscape is even
more impressive in dull lowering weather, when the
inky clouds that envelop the sky give promise of the
approaching hurricane. At such times a striking phenomenon,
said to be peculiar to the Parthenopean shores,
may be observed. From out the purple threatening
masses that fill the heavens there suddenly falls a
shaft of rosy light, as though directed by some vast
celestial lens fixed aloft in the sky, upon a small
portion of the opposite shore. The plateau of Sorrento
with its many white hamlets first becomes illuminated;
then the light rapidly passes towards Vesuvius, which
is instantly revealed with marvellous clearness, whilst
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Sorrento returns to its former dark brooding shadows.
For some moments we watch the circlet of towns that
fringe the base of the burning mountain and Camaldoli
erect on its wooded height, and then our gaze is
diverted towards Naples, so clearly revealed that one
can almost fancy it possible to detect the carriages
driving along the white line of the Caracciolo. From
the city this weird fairy-like light glides swiftly towards
the headland of Posilipo and the great sombre mass
of Ischia, and then finally seems to vanish altogether
in the leaden-hued expanse of the watery horizon.
Storm, rain, wind, hail and thunder will certainly
follow the appearance of this fantastic rose-coloured
glow, and the visitor to Capri may in consequence be
compelled to remain willy-nilly upon the island until
such time as communication with Naples shall be
once more restored, for rough weather on Capri means
complete isolation from the mainland and the outside
world. A spell of four or five days without a letter
or a newspaper may in certain cases be restful and
even beneficial, but it can also be highly inconvenient.

Comparatively few persons are aware that in the
history of Capri is to be found a page, not a particularly
glorious one perhaps, of the annals of our own
nation. In the spring of 1806, the year after Trafalgar,
whilst our fleet was blockading Naples on behalf of its
worthless monarch, King Ferdinand, then skulking in
cowardly ease at Palermo, Admiral Sir Sidney Smith,
the hero of Acre, managed to capture the island after
a sharp struggle with the French troops then holding
it in the name of Joachim Murat, King of Naples
and brother-in-law of the great Napoleon. Sir Hudson
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>(then Colonel) Lowe—afterwards famous as the
Governor of St Helena during Buonaparte’s captivity—was
now put in command of the newly conquered
island with some 1500 English and Maltese troops
at his disposal. Lowe and his second in command,
Major Hamill, at once set to work to put the place
into a strong state of defence, and so satisfied were
they with their work of fortification, that Lowe in his
confidence nick-named the islet <span class="tei tei-q">“Little Gibraltar.”</span>
For more than two years the Union Jack floated in
triumph from the fort-crowned heights of Capri, much
to the annoyance of the monarch on the mainland,
who finally determined at all costs to recapture the
stronghold facing his capital. Fancying himself perfectly
secure in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Little Gibraltar,”</span> now deemed
impregnable by a combination of art and nature against
any hostile descent, Lowe made light of any possible
expedition from Naples, and when Neapolitan warships
actually appeared as though making to land troops
at the Marinas on either side of the saddle of the
island, the British commandant was delighted at the
ease with which these attempts were repelled. But
whilst the garrison was busied in thwarting the movements
on the Marinas, which in reality only constituted
a feint on Murat’s part, transports were engaged in
disembarking at the low cliffs of Orico, the western
extremity of the island, boat-loads of men, who quickly
swarmed up the terraced slopes towards Ana-Capri
and surprised its garrison. On the following day,
October 6th 1808, in spite of Lowe’s efforts, Ana-Capri
with its eight hundred men surrendered to the
French and Neapolitan troops led by General Lamarque,
who at once set up a battery on the crest of the Solaro,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>so as to command the town of Capri and the English
head-quarters, fixed at the Convent of the Certosa that
lies between the Tragara Road and the southern shore.
The eastern half of the island still of course remained
in the hands of the British; and failing to reduce the
town itself and the Convent of the Certosa by bombardment
from above, General Lamarque decided upon
taking the place by storm, so as to forestall the arrival
of the English fleet, which was hourly expected to come
to the rescue of the beleaguered garrison. As we
have already mentioned, there was no road existing
upon the whole island in those days a hundred years
ago, so that in order to attack the capital, the French
general had to march his victorious troops by the
precipitous flight of stone steps down to the Marina
Grande and then try to carry the position from below.
Before however the Frenchmen, now further aided by
supplies sent by Murat’s order from Sorrento, could
arrange for the projected assault upon the town, the
delayed British fleet suddenly appeared in the offing,
evidently with the intention of bearing down upon the
island. But on this occasion the luck was all on the
side of the French, for scarcely had the eagerly expected
ships hove in sight, than the besieged garrison
had the mortification to see their hopes of succour
overthrown by the uprising of one of those sudden
squalls, so common on the Mediterranean, which drove
the warships southward. More than one assault was
repulsed with heavy loss by the small English garrison,
which had already been deprived of half its numbers
at Ana-Capri, including the gallant Major Hamill,
whose death is commemorated in a marble tablet set
in the little piazza of the town. But with the
re<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tirement of the relieving fleet and the continuance
of foul weather, Colonel Lowe deemed it useless to
resist further, and like a sensible man decided to
capitulate on the best terms he could obtain. In
return for his immediate surrender of Capri the British
commandant accordingly stipulated that his garrison
should be allowed to embark and sail for Sicily unmolested,
and that the persons and property of the
islanders, who seem to have appreciated the British
occupation, should be respected. But Lamarque, on
communicating Colonel Lowe’s request to King Murat,
received peremptory orders to demand an unconditional
surrender, whereupon an aide-de-camp of the King’s, a
certain Colonel Manches, was sent to interview Lowe
with the royal letter in his pocket. Had the missive
been delivered to him, the British Governor would in
all probability have decided to fight to the bitter end
rather than to submit to such severe and humiliating
conditions. Happily so terrible a catastrophe, which
must have involved heavy loss of life on both sides,
followed by a sack of the town, was unexpectedly,
averted at the last moment, for whilst Manches was
actually advancing with a flag of truce, the approach
of the British fleet was again signalled from the look-out
on the hill now called the Telegrafo. Before the
Governor could be made aware of this piece of
news, Colonel Manches, cunningly keeping his master’s
imperious letter in his pocket, told Colonel Lowe that
King Murat was ready to accept the terms of surrender
offered. The weather being propitious, the British fleet
would have been able this time to reach the island,
but its nearer approach was prevented by Colonel
Lowe himself, who sent to acquaint the Admiral,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>much to his chagrin, of the compact already concluded
with the besiegers, a compact which, as Hudson Lowe
himself very properly pointed out, was binding upon
the British Government. On October 26th, three
weeks from the date of the first attack, the English
troops embarked for Sicily, and the island was
formally handed over to the French and Neapolitan
forces, who held it undisturbed until the close of the
Napoleonic Wars.

the headland of Misenum to the island and port
of Procida, the <span class="tei tei-q">“alta Prochyta”</span> of Virgil. Although
the poet calls the island lofty, it is remarkably flat
considering its volcanic origin, for Procida and Ischia
were undoubtedly one in remote ages, as the learned
Strabo rightly conjectured. Its only eminence is the
Rocciola, the castle-crowned hillock to the north-east
of the island, but as this hill must first have caught
the expectant eye of Aeneas’ steersman, perhaps the
epithet is after all not so misplaced as would appear
at first sight. Carefully tilled and densely populated,
the island produces a large proportion of the fruit,
vegetables, and olive oil, that are sold in the Naples
market, and as it possesses no remains of antiquity,
no medieval churches, no works of art, and but few
beauties of nature to recommend it for inspection,
Procida is rarely visited by strangers. Its inhabitants,
who are chiefly husbandmen, are hard working
and independent, and content also to retain the
manners and customs of their frugal forefathers, and

observed in tourist-haunted Capri or Sorrento. Unconcerned
at the progress of the world without, unspoiled
by the gold of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">forestiere</span></span>, the Procidani pursue the

Built by Alphonso V. of Aragon in the fifteenth
century, this massive pile, half-fortress and half-palace,
is famous in Italian annals for its long
association with the noble poetess Vittoria Colonna,
Marchioness of Pescara. Born in the old Castle
of Marino, near Rome, one of the strongholds of
the great feudal house of Colonna, the poetess, who
was great-great-niece to Pope Martin V., was betrothed
in her infancy at the instigation of King Ferdinand
of Naples to the youthful heir of the d’Avalos family,
hereditary governors of the island of Ischia. The
elder sister of Vittoria’s affianced husband, Constance
d’Avalos, the widowed Duchess of Francavilla, was
the <span class="tei tei-q">“châtelaine”</span> of Ischia during her brother’s
minority, so that it was but natural that his Colonna
bride-elect should be sent to dwell with Constance
in this castle. Here Vittoria under her sister-in-law’s
excellent tutelage grew up to womanhood amidst the
intellectual atmosphere of the Italian Renaissance, and
here she was trained to develop into one of the most
learned, the most interesting and the most attractive
figures that all Italy produced at this period. Childless
in her early marriage at eighteen, and with her husband
frequently, not to say usually, engaged in military
expeditions on the mainland, Vittoria had every
opportunity of cultivating her mind and of filling her
sea-girt palace with men of genius. The poets Cariteo
and Bernado Tasso (the father of Torquato Tasso),
were frequent visitors at this

Strange to relate, her husband, the Marquis of
Pescara, was destined to forestall his learned lady in
the matter of poetry, for during his imprisonment at
Milan in the year 1512, he composed a <span class="tei tei-q">“Dialogo
d’Amore”</span> to send to his sorrowing wife at Ischia, a
production which the learned Paolo Giovio, the historian
and bishop of Nocera, pronounced as being <span class="tei tei-q">“summae
jucunditatis,”</span> though in reality it seems to have been
feeble enough. But however halting and commonplace
the warrior’s verses, Pescara’s composition had
the immediate effect of opening the flood-gates of his
wife’s poetic temperament, for she replied at once to
her spouse’s effort with an epistle conceived in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">terza rima</span></span> employed by Dante, and though the poem
is turgid in diction and shallow in thought, full of
classical names and allusions, <span class="tei tei-q">“a parade of all the
treasures of the school-room,”</span> it exhibits the graceful
ease and high scholarship which mark all Vittoria’s
writings. Meanwhile, unblest with offspring of her
own and ever separated by the cruel circumstance
of war from the husband she seemed perfectly content
to admire from a distance, Vittoria did not expend
all her time at Ischia in sacrificing to Apollo
and the Muses, for she now undertook the education
of her husband’s young cousin and heir, Alphonso
d’Avalos, Marchese del Vasto, whose manhood certainly
did credit to his instructress, for del Vasto
under her influence grew up to be a brave soldier and
a tolerable scholar.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After sixteen years of married life with a husband
who, although professing deep devotion to his brilliant
and virtuous consort, was almost invariably absent from
her side, Vittoria found herself left a widow shortly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>after the great battle of Pavia in 1525 wherein Francis I.
of France surrendered to the Emperor Charles V. The
Marquis of Pescara, after the usual career of bloodthirsty
adventures which passed in those days for a life of
knight-errantry, died at Milan towards the close
of this year, leaving behind him an unenviable reputation
for treachery towards his master. But however
hard were the things said of the deceased Fernando
d’Avalos by the outside world, no breath of suspicion
seems ever to have penetrated to the heart of the faithful
if placid Vittoria, who mourned bitterly if somewhat
theatrically over her departed hero. The Lady
of the Rock was now in her thirty-fifth year, and her
beauty, so we are told, still remained undimmed; in
fact it was rather improved by a tendency towards
plumpness, for sorrow and poetry are not necessarily
associated with a meagre appearance. Spending her
time partly in the great Italian cities, but chiefly on
her beloved <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">scoglio superbo</span></span>, the widow of Pescara now
set herself to write that series of sonnets in memory of
her dead husband which have rescued his unworthy
name from oblivion and have rendered her own famous
in Italian literature. For the sonnets of Vittoria
Colonna, though appearing cold classical and pedantic
to our northern ideas, evidently appeal to the Italian
temperament, so that the praises of Pescara and his
widow’s stilted complaints, couched in the elegant
language of the Renaissance, are still read and appreciated
to-day by her compatriots. As time passed,
and the ghost of sorrowful remorse was supposed to
be decently laid, the sonnets contain somewhat less of
hero-worship, and assume a religious and speculative
character. Some critics have even gone so far as to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>affect to perceive a latent spirit of Protestantism
underlying the graceful platitudes and commonplace
but grandly expressed ideas. Very likely the Lady
of the Rock dabbled in the fashionable heterodoxy of
the hour, as it is at least certain that she was on terms
of intimacy with the celebrated Princess Renée, the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Protestant”</span> Duchess of Ferrara. On the other hand,
several of her acquaintances and correspondents were
amongst the most prominent of the unyielding
Churchmen of the day; in their number being, it is
interesting to note, Cardinal Reginald Pole, great-nephew
of King Edward IV. of England and afterwards
Queen Mary’s Archbishop of Canterbury, who
was certainly not likely to encourage Vittoria’s unorthodox
or reforming tendencies. <span class="tei tei-q">“The more
opportunity,”</span> so writes the poetess to Cardinal Cervino,
afterwards Pope Marcellus II., <span class="tei tei-q">“I have had of observing
the actions of his Eminence the Cardinal of England,
the more clear has it seemed to me that he is a true
and sincere servant of God. Whenever, therefore, he
charitably condescends to give me his opinion on any
point, I conceive myself safe from error in following
his advice.”</span> And on the strength of Cardinal Pole’s
astute counsels, Vittoria promptly broke off all communication
with the leading reformer, Bernardino
Ochino, and (a thing which does not strike us as particularly
honourable) forwarded his letters to herself
unopened to his spiritual adversaries. But it is
evident that Vittoria’s <span class="tei tei-q">“Protestantism”</span> was a mere
pose, assumed at a time when adverse criticism from
all sides was being levelled at the political abuses of
the Papacy and at the various scandals in the Church
which were patent to the eyes of all onlookers. In
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>short her religious verses are if anything more frigid and
artificial than those which compose the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In Memoriam</span></span>
to her husband, her <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bel Sole</span></span>, as she usually terms him.
Whilst admitting considerable merit in Vittoria’s compositions,
we find it at this distance of time very
difficult to understand the extravagant praise which
was showered upon her poems by the Italian critics of
the day, or to conceive how a sonnet from the gifted
pen of the Marchioness of Pescara could possibly have
been considered an important event in the literary
world by cardinals, princes, poets, wits and scholars.
From Naples to Rome, from Rome to Ferrara, from
Ferrara to Mantua and Milan, the precious manuscript
containing the last-born sonnet of the illustrious Lady
of Ischia was eagerly passed along. Court poets read
aloud amidst breathless silence the divine Vittoria’s
fourteen lines of jejune sentiment draped in folds of
elegant verbiage; nobles and prelates applauded,
hailing the authoress as a heaven-sent genius. Sincere
to a certain extent this strange admiration undoubtedly
was, although the homage was paid perhaps in
equal proportions to the excellence of the verse and
to the high rank of the author. She was a Colonna
by birth; she was the widow of a petty despot; she
was governor of a large island;—any literary production,
however indifferent, from so high a personage
would have been received throughout Italy with
respect or flattery. But Vittoria was no mean or
careless aspirant to fame; it was the fault of an
artificial age rather than the lack of her own natural
ability that has made her poetry cold and soulless,
for under healthy conditions of life and thought,
<span class="tei tei-q">“the Divine Vittoria”</span> was doubtless capable of
pro<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ducing something warmer and more human than the
lifeless but graceful sonnets that bear her name.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is chiefly through her close connexion with the
great literary movement of the Italian Renaissance
and her intimacy with its leading artists and writers,
rather than through her own reputation as a poetess,
that the name of Vittoria Colonna herself is remembered
outside the borders of Italy. With her
wealth, her culture, her virtue and her unique position
in the world of rank and of letters, it is nothing
marvellous that so fortunate and gifted a mortal
should have become the idol of the leading persons of
her day. She belonged, in fact, to a brilliant and
famous group of which she was the soul and centre;
of which she was at once the patron, the disciple and
the teacher. That great master of Italian prose,
Pietro Bembo, set a high value on her powers of
criticism; other men, almost as distinguished as the
Venetian cardinal, besought her for advice on literary
subjects. Foremost in her circle of admirers appears
of course the great Michelangelo, with whom the
immaculate Vittoria condescended to indulge in one
of those cold platonic pseudo-passions which constituted
the true <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">divino amore</span></span> of the idealists of the
Renaissance. So here was nothing to cavil at, nothing
to arouse base suspicion. Considered the greatest
man and the greatest woman in all Italy, both were
of mature age, he in the sixties and she in the forties,
when Michelangelo first professed himself seized with
a pure but unquenchable love and devotion for the
widowed Lady of the Rock.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The last days of Vittoria, which were chiefly spent
within the walls of the Convent of Sant’ Anna at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Rome, were clouded by ill-health and sorrow. The
death of the young Marchese del Vasto, <span class="tei tei-q">“her moral
and intellectual son,”</span> was an irreparable loss, for which
her boundless fame and popularity could offer little
real consolation. At length the poetess, feeling death
approaching, moved to the house of Giulia Colonna,
her relative, and there expired in February 1547, in
the fifty-seventh year of her age. To the last her
death-bed was surrounded by sorrowing and adoring
friends, amongst them being Michelangelo, who is said
to have witnessed with his own eyes the last moments
of his beloved Lady. And the famous sculptor,
painter and poet—perhaps the most stupendous
genius the world has yet produced—is reported to
have bitterly regretted in after years that on so solemn
an occasion he had not ventured to imprint one chaste
kiss upon the forehead of the woman he had adored
so ardently, yet so purely during life. By her expressed
wish the body of the poetess was buried in
San Domenico Maggiore at Naples, the finest and
least spoiled of all the Neapolitan churches, where
a velvet-covered coffin containing the ashes of the
Divine Vittoria and her <span class="tei tei-q">“Bel Sole,”</span> and surmounted
by the sword, banner and portrait of Fernando d’Avalos,
is still pointed out to the stranger, resting on
a shelf in the sacristy of the church. We cannot but
regret that Vittoria’s body did not find a final resting-place
in her <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">superbo scoglio</span></span>, where all her happiest years
were spent and where her memory still survives so fresh.

Ischia itself is a quaint, dirty, straggling town,
possessing a small cathedral of ancient foundation,
but modernised within and without, its sole object of
interest being a curious font resting on marble lions.
The charm of the city lies chiefly in the busy scenes
to be witnessed daily on its sandy beach and on the
stone causeway that leads to the Castle, where a large
part of the population seems to spend most of its
time in mending the deep brown fishing nets or in
attending to the gaudily painted boats.

Almost adjoining the outskirts of the little capital
of the island is Porto d’Ischia, with a deep circular
harbour that was once the crater of an extinct volcano,
wherein every variety of Mediterranean fishing craft
is to be seen at anchor. Close to the port, embowered
among groves of orange and lemon trees that in
winter time are laden with bright or pale yellow
fruit, stands a fine old villa of the Bourbon kings
of Naples, once a favourite summer retreat of his
Majesty King Bomba. Royalty has long abandoned
Ischia, and the villa has now been converted into a
bath house. Beyond its neglected park stretches an
extensive pine forest, carpeted in spring time with
daisies, marigolds and anemones, and even in February
gay with yellow oxalis and redolent with the scent of
hidden violets.

walls of the domed cottages, the flat roofs and cisterns,

tinklings of the goat bells among the thickets of

Neapolitan Riviera. Our destination at length is
reached, the roadway crossing the deep valley of the
Gurgitello with its sulphur baths, which once had a
wide reputation and are still much frequented in the
summer months by the people of Naples. Although
the sources of the springs were certainly damaged by
the earthquake of 1883, new bathing establishments
have been built, and a fair number of patients are
once more availing themselves of these beneficent
waters, which of course are warranted to heal every
bodily evil under the sun. A course of the Ischian

Formerly the most populous and prosperous township
of the whole island, Casamicciola consists to-day
principally of a mass of shapeless ruins, together with
a number of dismal corrugated iron huts grouped
round an ugly modern church, nor can its exquisite
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>views and luxuriant gardens make amends for the
settled air of melancholy which continues to brood
over this unlucky spot. Every reader will doubtless
remember the story of the terrible earthquake of
July 28th 1883, when almost without warning the
whole town, then crowded with its usual influx of
summer visitors, was overthrown and engulfed in
the space of a few seconds of time. Hotels, villas,
churches, cottages, all suffered equally, and though the
exact number of those who perished of all classes
will never be known, the most moderate accounts put
the figure as high as 3000 souls. Several English
people lost their lives in that brief but terrible
upheaval, and as many of the bodies as were
recovered from the wreckage were laid to rest in the
little cemetery outside the town, a plot of ground
overhanging the sea, and shaded by cypress and
eucalyptus trees. Many and impressive are the
stories still to be heard from the lips of the present
inhabitants, who are wont to date all events from
that fearful night of darkness and destruction, and
who all have piteous tales to tell of relations killed

miraculous escape on the occasion, gave us a most
vivid and heart-rending description of how her hotel
and most of its inmates were overwhelmed on that
awful July night, and how the existing inn is literally
built upon foundations that are filled with many
unrecovered bodies of victims. It was on a dark
sultry night after the evening meal had been finished,
when the many guests of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Piccola Sentinella</span></span> were
sitting in the public rooms or on the terrace overlooking
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the hotel gardens. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">salon</span></span> a young Englishman,
an accomplished musician, had been playing for some
time on the piano, when suddenly and unexpectedly
he plunged into the strains of Chopin’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Marche
Funèbre</span></span>, which had the immediate effect of scattering
his audience, since many of his listeners, not caring for
so melancholy a piece of music, deserted the room
for the garden. Lucky indeed were those persons
driven forth by the strains of Chopin’s dirge, for
a few moments later came the earthquake, when in a
trice the whole hotel was swallowed up in the yawning
chasm of the earth. Everybody inside the walls
was killed, and the body of the poor pianist was
actually discovered later amidst the wreckage, crushed
down upon the instrument which had struck the
warning notes of impending disaster. The horrors
of that night still linger vividly in the memory of the
people, and many are the terrible incidents, and many
also, we are glad to say, the acts of bravery which are
recorded of it. One elderly English lady, who owned
a small villa on the slope above the hotel, rushed at
the first suspicion of the catastrophe into the stone
archway of a window, whence she beheld the whole of
her house collapse like a castle of cards around her.
Nothing daunted by the spectacle, this gallant woman,
as soon as the shock had ceased and the clouds of
dust rising from the ruin had cleared away, left her
own dismantled home, of which nothing but the one
wall that had sheltered her remained standing, and
joined the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">parrocco</span></span>, the parish priest of Casamicciola,
in the task of succouring the living and comforting
the dying. To the darkness of the night was now
added a heavy rainfall, yet the good priest and this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>noble woman traversed together the altered and
devastated scene amidst the wet and gloom on their
errand of mercy. It is some satisfaction to learn that
this piece of unselfish heroism and devotion on the
part of the priest was officially acknowledged, for the
humble curate of Casamicciola was afterwards made
a prelate by Pope Leo XIII. in recognition of his
signal services. Even to-day people are inclined to
be somewhat chary of spending any length of time
in this unfortunate spot, where the ruined streets and
shapeless mounds of earth, only too suggestive of a
latter-day Pompeii, speak so eloquently of terrible
experiences in the past and of possible dangers in the
future. Nevertheless, if one can triumph over these
gloomy feelings, Casamicciola affords a delightful
centre whence to explore the whole island, and many
are the pleasant walks to be found on the overhanging
slopes of Mont’ Epomeo, and many the boating
expeditions to be made from the Marina below the
upper town.

It is a two-mile walk through stony lanes overhung
by branches of fig and orange from Casamicciola to
Lacco, a large village well situated on a little bay
which is distinguished by a curious mushroom-shaped
rock, aptly nicknamed <span class="tei tei-q">“Il Fungo”</span> by the natives.
This place, which also suffered severely in the earthquake
of 1883, is the head-quarters of the straw-plaiting
industry of the island, the women and children noisily
beseeching every chance visitor to buy their wares in
the guise of baskets, hats and fans; the pretty coloured
tiles (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mattoni</span></span>), which are used with such good effect in
the churches and houses of the island, are likewise
manufactured here. Lacco is particularly associated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with the great annual festival of St Restituta on May
17th, which is always marked by religious processions
and by universal merry-making, followed by illuminations
and fireworks at nightfall. This saint, of whom
an early mosaic portrait still exists in her ancient chapel
within the Neapolitan Cathedral, was once the patroness
of the city of Naples, but since medieval times she has
been honoured as the special guardian of this island,
whither her body (so the legend runs) was miraculously
conveyed from Egypt in a boat rowed by angels. A
local tradition also asserts that on her landing by the
beach of Lacco, an Egyptian lotus bloom was found
in the saint’s hand, as fresh as when it had been
plucked months before from the banks of the Nile.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Leaving the little bay with its sulphur-impregnated
sands, and turning inland, we proceed along a road
across an ancient lava-stream over-grown with pine
trees, wild caper and a tangle of aromatic brushwood,
to Forio, which with its white domed houses, its palm
trees, and its stately bare-footed women bearing tall
pitchers on their heads gives at first acquaintance the
full impression of an Oriental city. There is little to
be seen in Forio itself, with the exception of some fine
vestments of needlework that are preserved in the
sacristy of its principal church, but no traveller should
fail to visit its wonderfully picturesque Franciscan
monastery, a barbaric-looking pile of dazzling white
walls and cupolas set against a background of cobalt
waters, which stands outside the town on a rocky platform
jutting into the Mediterranean and is approached
by a broad flight of marble steps adorned with most
realistic figures of souls burning in brightly painted
flames of Purgatory. This point too commands a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>good view of the extreme north-eastern promontory
of the island, a tall cliff known as the Punta del
Imperatore in honour of the great Emperor Charles
the Fifth, beyond which visitors rarely penetrate owing
to the roughness, or rather non-existence of roads,
though the southern side of the island, which lies
between this cape and the castle of Ischia, is fully as
beautiful as the northern portion just described.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The chief attraction, however, of a visit to Ischia is
the ascent of Mont’ Epomeo, an easy expedition on
foot to the active, and feasible to the weak or lazy on
mule-back. This extinct volcano, whose broad lofty
summit is visible from many points of the Bay of
Naples, is naturally rich in classical associations, the
ancients believing that within it lay imprisoned the
giant Typhoeus, whose agonised movements were wont
to cause the frequent eruptions of the crater that
eventually drove away the early Greek settlers from
this island—the Aenaria or Inarime of antiquity—and
in later times accounted for the neglect of Ischia
as a winter resort by the luxurious Romans, in spite
of its near presence to fashionable Baiae. So destructive
of life and property were these convulsions of
nature, that for long periods, notwithstanding its fertile
soil and its lucrative fisheries, the island remained
uninhabited, and an old tradition, mentioned by Ovid,
derives one of its ancient names, Pithecusa, from a
race of apes (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pithēkoi</span></span>) that dwelt on its abandoned
shores. Since the great eruption of 1302, the effects
of which can still be traced among the large pine
woods near Porto d’Ischia, the mountain has been
quiescent, and the population of the island has increased
considerably, although the constant shocks of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>earthquake have always made a permanent residence
in Ischia somewhat insecure. Nor can we rest assured
that Typhoeus himself is truly dead, not merely sleeping,
but ready to renew his fierce efforts after his long
spell of slumber, and to change the face of nature as
unexpectedly as did the Demon of Vesuvius in the
reign of Titus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Like the great volcano of Etna, which the Ischian
mountain somewhat resembles on a tiny scale.
Epomeo contains three distinct climatic zones. The
lowest is that of the coast line with its rich sub-tropical
vegetation, the early part of the ascent leading by steep
stony paths through sun-baked vineyards which produce
the white wine of Ischia, wholesome and light but
somewhat acid in taste. For the storing of this vintage
the peasants make use of the numerous old stone
towers, that once served as safe retreats for the terrified
inhabitants in times when the Barbary pirates frequently
descended on the Italian coasts to plunder and enslave.
Very curious it is to step out of the blinding sunlight
into the interior of one of these medieval buildings,
where in the icy gloom stand great barrels of the new
white wine, each carefully inscribed with a prayer in
praise of St Restituta, from one of which the swarthy
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">contadino</span></span>, in expectation of a few pence, draws a glassful
of the sour chilly liquid to offer his visitor. Leaving
behind this region of houses and of cultivation, the
zone of forest is reached, covered with woods of chestnut
and oak, with a thick undergrowth of heather, myrtle,
laurustinus and sweet-scented yellow coronella; there
is grass under our feet, and long-stemmed daisies,
violets, mauve anemones and small fragrant marigolds
everywhere. Through the trees comes the nasal but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>not unmelodious singing of an unseen charcoal-burner,
or the plaintive note of the little goat-herd’s rustic pipe,
accompanied by the musical jingling of his goat-bells;—for
a moment we try to fancy ourselves in the pastoral
Italy of Theocritus, where nymphs and shepherds,
peasants and dryads, lived together on terms of amity
in the woods. But soon the chestnut trees appear
stunted, and the groves become less thick, and we
finally gain the last zone, the desolate expanse of naked
rock and dark lava deposits of the summit, where only
a few hardy weeds can thrive. Here in some damp
mouldy chambers dwells a hermit, for nearly all the
classic mountains of Southern Italy are tenanted by an
anchorite, generally an old and ignorant, but pious
peasant, of the type of Pietro Murrone, the holy recluse
of the Abruzzi, who was finally dragged from his cell to be
invested forcibly with the pontifical robes and tiara as
Celestine the Fifth. The present hermitage on Mont’
Epomeo dates however from comparatively modern
times, for its first occupant is said to have been a
German nobleman, a certain Joseph Arguth, governor
of Ischia under the first Bourbon king, who in consequence
of a solemn vow made in battle deliberately
passed his last years of existence on the topmost peak
of the island he had lately ruled. His example has
been followed and his cell filled by many successors,
who have endured the spring rains, the summer heats,
the autumn storms and the winter chills upon this airy
height, where the glorious view may be found a compensation
for eternal discomfort, if hermits condescend
to appreciate anything so mundane as scenery. The
shrine and cell are dedicated to St Nicholas of Bari,
and to this circumstance is due the local uninteresting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>name of Monte San Niccolò to the entire mountain,
whose crest, some 3000 feet above sea-level, we finally
gain by means of steps roughly hewn in the lava.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The view from this height, embracing two out of
the three historic bays of the Parthenopean coast, is
one of the noblest and most extensive in Southern
Italy. Looking southward, the fantastic cliffs of Capri
are seen to rise abruptly from the ocean; beyond them
appears the graceful outline of Monte Sant’ Angelo,
with the crater of Vesuvius beside it, veiling the clear
blue sky with volumes of dusky smoke. Beneath
extends the broken line of shore, stretching north and
south as far as the eye can travel, with its classic capes
and islands basking in the strong sunshine; whilst
behind the foam-fringed boundary of land and sea
rises the jagged line of the Abruzzi Mountains with
the huge snow-clad mass of the Gran Sasso d’Italia
towering above the lower peaks. At our feet is spread
the beautiful and fertile island, in outward appearance
little changed since the days when the good Bishop
Berkeley <span class="tei tei-q">“of every virtue under Heaven”</span> penned its
description nearly two centuries ago in a letter to
Alexander Pope, wherein he described Ischia as <span class="tei tei-q">“an
epitome of the whole earth.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In spite of the good Bishop’s eloquent tribute to the
genial climate and the natural beauty of Ischia, it
must be borne in mind that a residence on the island
possesses one or two serious drawbacks. Apart from
the ever-present fear of earthquakes, which hangs like
the sword of Damocles above the heads of the inhabitants,
there is yet another disadvantage, prosaic
but very real, in the lack of pure water, every well
and rivulet on Ischia being more or less impregnated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with sulphur, with the result that water for drinking
(and in summer even for domestic) purposes has to be
conveyed by boat from Naples. It is bad enough to
be dependant on a distant city for a food supply (which
is to some extent also the case here), but the possibility
of enduring a water famine through storms or misadventure
would be a far more serious calamity;
nevertheless as casual visitors to this charming and
little-known island, we can easily afford to smile at
such misfortunes.<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a>

Passing along the noisy thronged street of the
Chiaja and plunging thence into the chill
gloomy recesses of the ancient grotto of Posilipo,
we emerge at its further side into a new world, as
it were, into a district where <span class="tei tei-q">“there is scarcely a spot
which is not identified with the poetical mythology
of Greece, or associated with some name familiar in
the history of Rome.”</span> In truth, the headland of
Posilipo presents a wonderful landmark in the history
of Naples, for it forms a barrier between the busy
world of to-day and the departed civilisation of the
ancients: at the latter end of this tunnel, the fierce
life and movement of a great commercial city; at its
western exit, a tract of land teeming with recollections
of the glorious past.

As our carriage emerges once more into the warmth
and sunlight, we find ourselves in the miserable village
of Fuorigrotta, which, by a strange coincidence, is
associated with the memory of a famous Italian poet.
For if the name and verses of Sannazzaro cling to
Piedigrotta and the Parthenopean shore on the eastern
side of the hill, the genius of Count Giacomo Leopardi
sheds its melancholy radiance over the unlovely purlieus
of Fuorigrotta. Here in the vestibule of the parish
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>church of San Vitale, lie the ashes of that unhappy
writer, the Shelley of Italian literature, who so bewailed
the Austrian and Bourbon fetters that enchained his
native land. Poor Leopardi! It was but eleven years
before the first great movement of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Risorgimento</span></span>
swept over Italy in 1848 that he passed away; his
poems were indeed songs before sunrise, a sunrise of
which he failed to detect the far-off glimmering, so
that he could only lament without hope the sad
condition of his dismembered country, once the
mistress and now the play-thing of the world, and
the abject slave of hated Austria:

It is a flat dusty stretch of road that lies between
Fuorigrotta and Bagnoli; the high walls give only
occasional glimpses of well-tilled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">parterres</span></span>—one
cannot call these tiny patches of cultivation fields—with
thriving crops of brilliant green corn, of claret-red
clover, of purple lucerne, and of the white-flowered
<span class="tei tei-q">“sad lupin,”</span> which Vergil has immortalised in verse.
The round bright yellow beans of the lupin crop, known
locally by the name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">spassa-tiempî</span></span> (time-killers),
afford an article of food to the very poorest of the
population. A quaint story runs that one day an
impoverished philosopher, reduced to making his
dinner off a handful of these beans, and imagining
himself in consequence the most wretched wight in
existence, was cheered and comforted by observing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>himself followed by a still more miserable fellow-mortal,
who was engaged in picking up and eating
the husks of the beans that, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">more italiano</span></span>, he had
thrown carelessly on to the pathway after their insipid
farinaceous contents had been sucked out!

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Above us to the right are the heights of Monte
Spina, covered with groves of the umbrella pine, the
typical tree of Naples; to our left extends the verdant
ridge of Posilipo, ending in Cape Coroglio, beyond
which the massive form of Nisida rises proudly from
the blue expanse of water. All the landscape shows
somewhat hard in the glare of noontide, and we find
the enveloping clouds of fine white dust very oppressive
and disagreeable. From time to time a lumbering
country cart is passed with its attendant bare-footed
peasant; otherwise there is little sign of life on the
high road. The bright sunlight flashes upon the
horse’s polished brass harness, and upon the elaborate
erection of charms placed thereon, with the avowed
object of averting the dreaded Evil Eye, that everlasting
bugbear of all dwellers upon these southern
shores. On his poor drooping head the worn-out old
steed carries a large bell with four jingling clappers
and two brazen crescents, the horns of one of which
point upwards and of the other towards the ground.
On the off-side of the headgear is a bunch of bright-coloured
ribbands or woollen tassels, from which
depends the single horn, the invaluable Neapolitan
talisman that is supposed to protect every man,
woman, child or beast, from the chance glance of
a passing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jettatore</span></span>. Above this glowing mass of
colour some three or four feathers of a pheasant’s
tail are stuck, apparently with no ulterior purpose
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>than that of ornament; but beside the bunch of
ribbands there is also fixed a piece of wolf’s skin,
to give strength to the jaded animal, for, remarks
the sapient Pliny, <span class="tei tei-q">“a wolf’s skin attached to a horse’s
neck will render him proof against all weariness.”</span>
Personally, we should think a little more consideration
and some elementary knowledge of farriery
would have been of more service to the ill-used
beasts round Naples than the excellent Pliny’s
highly original receipt. Besides this powerful battery
of charms to intercept the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jettatura</span></span>, there is the light
brass headpiece engraved with sacred figures, so
that any evil glance must be fully absorbed, baffled
or exhausted, before it can fix itself upon the animal.
In addition however to this shining mass of headgear,
the horse carries on his back one of those
curious high pommels that are peculiar to Southern
Italy and Sicily. The front of the pommel itself is
of well-polished brass, and covered with a number of
studs, whilst at its back is fastened a miniature
barrel, upon which there stands erect the figure of
some local saint, generally that of San Gennaro.
The exact part that the barrel and the row of studs
play in this mystic battle against the Evil Eye is
unknown, but the two revolving flags of brass that
swing and creak above the pommel itself are believed
to represent <span class="tei tei-q">“the flaming sword which turned every
way,”</span> and finally expelled Adam and Eve from the
Garden of Eden. Certainly this shimmering metal
has the appearance of a flaming sword in the bright
sunshine, so that it ought to prove efficacious in
catching and averting any baleful glance. A second
patch of wolf skin on the crest of the pommel, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>some red worsted wound round the spindle of the
flags complete the list of strange charms that are
considered necessary to protect a Neapolitan horse
from the pernicious influence of a casual passer-by.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We soon reach the sea-shore at Bagnoli, a little
watering-place much frequented by Neapolitans of
the middle classes, and on looking back we obtain a
charming view of the headland of Posilipo and of
stately Nisida, the Nesis of the ancients, with its
memories of Brutus, <span class="tei tei-q">“the noblest Roman of them all,”</span>
who on this little island bade farewell for ever to his
devoted Portia. A very different tenant from the chaste
Portia, however, who once possessed a villa in this
sea-girt retreat during the Middle Ages, was Queen
Joanna the Second, the last member of the Durazzo
branch of the Angevin royal house, and sister and
heiress of King Ladislaus II., whose splendid monument
in San Giovanni a Carbonara is one of the chief
artistic treasures of Naples. It is of course unnecessary
here to remark that there were two Queens of Naples,
both Joanna by name, and that the first of these, the
contemporary of Petrarch (whose proper feeling she contrived
to shock) was certainly not a pattern of female
virtue, but that she shone as a moral paragon when
contrasted with her name-sake and successor, the sister
of King Ladislaus. Of this second Queen, tradition
more or less accurate relates a host of stories, none of
them to her credit; how she dabbled in necromancy
and was immersed in love intrigues, the most celebrated
of which was her amour with the handsome <span class="tei tei-q">“Ser.
Gianni,”</span> Giovanni Caracciolo, head of an eminent
family that has figured prominently in Neapolitan
history from the days of Angevin monarchs to those
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of King Ferdinand. Little good did the fickle Queen’s
favour do Ser. Gianni, who suffered an ignominious fate
for having one day boxed Joanna’s ears during a lovers’
tiff. Murdered secretly by four assassins, Caracciolo’s
body was laid to rest in the family chapel in San
Giovanni a Carbonara beneath a splendid monument
which is surmounted by the luckless favourite’s
effigy. Joanna the First with all her faults was never
guilty of such light conduct as this, but the peasant
mind is always impatient of dry details of fact, so that
in the popular imagination to-day both Queens are
blended into one personage, whose character, it is needless
to say, is about as vile as can be conceived.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Siccome la Regina Giovanna,”</span> is a form of peasant
execration around Naples that has some historical
affinity with the time-honoured Irish <a name="corr300" id="corr300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">malediction</span> of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Curse o’ Cromwell.”</span>

Turning our backs on the island with its memories
of Portia the Perfect and of Queen Joanna the Improper,
we pursue our course along the sea-shore
with rocks of ancient lava above us to the right,
now heavily overgrown with brushwood and plants,
amongst which we notice tufts of the pretty wild
asparagus, that the observant Pliny centuries ago
found flourishing in this district. As an early herb,
coming into season long before its cultivated
cousin is fit for cutting, this succulent vegetable is
highly prized in the South, and its flavour though somewhat
bitter is most palatable, so that an omelette <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">aux
pointes d’asperges sauvages</span></span> is a dish not to be despised
by those who get the opportunity of testing this local
delicacy. Before us lies our goal, Pozzuoli, with its
ancient citadel jutting into the placid waters and backed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by the classic headland of Misenum, above which in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pozzuoli in recent years has been much neglected
by strangers, so much so that no inn worthy to be
called an hotel now exists, and such <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">trattorie</span></span> as the
place offers are all equally extortionate and detestable.
Some time ago there was a comfortable <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pension</span></span> at the
edge of the town on the road to the Amphitheatre,
but its English landlady has long since migrated elsewhere,
and the comfortable <span class="tei tei-q">“Hotel Grande Bretagne”</span>
is no more; whilst nowadays there are to be found
no visitors hardy enough to endure a prolonged
sojourn in the wretched hostelries of the town itself.
The electric tram and the rail-road have in fact killed
Pozzuoli as a winter resort, more’s the pity, for it is
not only a spot of singular interest in itself but
its climate is certainly superior to that of Naples, for
the great headland which shuts off the city from the
Phlegrean Fields serves also to act as a buffer against
the icy <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tramontana</span></span> that sweeps along the Chiaja in
winter and early spring. Invalids used at one time
to inhabit Pozzuoli on account of its mild atmosphere,
and even to visit the Solfatara daily on mule-back, in
order to inhale its sulphureous fumes, which were
then believed to be good for weak chests. But
medical fashions vary like all others, and consumptive
patients now seek other places <a name="corr301" id="corr301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">than</span> Pozzuoli for their
cure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many are the walks outside the town, and none
are without beauty or interest, for, the neighbourhood
of Syracuse excepted, we can think of no place
in Italy wherein one is brought so closely into touch
with the classical past. Nature has long clothed the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ruined area of the ancient city with her kindly
drapery of foliage and flowers, so that the crumbling
masses of tawny brick that we come across in our
rambles are all swathed in garlands of clematis, myrtle,
honey-suckle and coronella. It is a delight to
speculate upon the original use and appearance of
these shapeless blocks of creeper-clad masonry, which
attract the eye on all sides amidst the vineyards and
orange groves, where the peasants delving in the rich
soil frequently alight upon treasures of the antique
world. What a delight it is to wander through the
Street of Tombs—alas, long rifled of their contents!—where
the gay valerian and the pink silene sprout
from every fissure of the soft tufa rock, and lizards of
unusual size and brilliancy play games of hide-and-seek
in the warm sunshine. We moderns are afraid
of graveyards and the paraphernalia of the dead:
many a stout-hearted Englishman objects to passing
through a church-yard at night; not so the pagan
Romans, who placed their cemeteries in public places
and were wont to proceed through lines of tombs as
they entered the city of the living: a very salutary
and practical reminder of the transitory nature of
life itself. The whole neighbourhood in short is
sprinkled with these memorials of Imperial Rome;
there is not an orange or lemon orchard but stands
above some forgotten villa, not an acre of tilth but
must conceal some hidden mine of classical associations.
Charming too are the walks by the sea-shore—now sadly
disfigured by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cantiere Armstrong</span></span>, with its smoke
and ugliness looking like a dirty smudge upon the
delicate landscape of the Bay—for here again we find
endless traces of the Imperial age. There can be no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>more fascinating employment than to wander along
the beach after one of the heavy winter storms that so
often vex the quiet of the Bay of Naples, and to
search for fragments of precious marbles that have
been spied by the waves amidst the sunken foundations
of Roman villas, and thence idly flung upon the shore.
Pieces of the choicest white Parian, squares of speckled
Egyptian porphyry, of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">verde</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rosso</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">giallo antico</span></span>, of
the coal-black <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Africano</span></span>, all wet and glistening from
the waves, can be picked up by the quick-sighted, and
the gathering of these beautiful trifles, cut and polished
by skilled hands nearly two thousand years ago, makes
an interesting occupation. Nor is its classical lore
the only feature of the Bay of Baiae, for though its
actual scenery cannot compare with the grandeur of
Capri nor its vegetation with the rich luxuriance of
Sorrento, yet these shores have a quiet beauty of their
own. Vine, olive and almond abound on all sides,
and everywhere we see the groves of orange and
lemon that in spring time scent the air with their perfumed
blossoms. And in the early months of the
year every patch of warm-coloured, up-turned earth is
gay with sheets of that beautiful but rapacious weed,
hated of the peasant, the oxalis, with its clusters of
pale yellow flowers: a species of sorrel that is allied
to our own white-blossomed variety. From many a
point on the little ridges that rise behind Pozzuoli
magnificent views can be obtained, whilst to those who
care to study the scientific results of volcanic action
the Phlegraean Fields afford endless occupation and
interest. Every one of course visits the Solfatara, that
curious semi-extinct crater, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Forum Vulcani</span></span> of
Strabo, which has remained for over seven hundred
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>years in its present condition of languor. A strange
experience it is to enter the heart of a volcano that is
still comparatively active, and to observe woods of
poplar and a large pine tree beneath which grow
masses of spring flowers—bright blue bugloss, the
crimson vetch, starch hyacinths, purple self-heal, and
golden spurge—and to pass from these thickets on to
a space of bare white-coloured ground that trembles
and sways under the feet like a sheet of insecure ice.
Beyond, one sees the little fissures (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fumaroli</span></span>) emitting
fumes of sulphur, and the guides take us to stifling
caverns in the hill-side where we are shown the
beautiful primrose-coloured crystals. The Solfatara,
the Amphitheatre and the Temple of Serapis, these
are the recognised <span class="tei tei-q">“sights”</span> of Pozzuoli, which strangers
visit to-day in the space of an hour or two, and then
return to Naples comforted with the feeling that they
have exhausted the attractions of the place. Certainly
their reception in the town is not likely to
inspire them with a wish to return, for the guides and
touts swarm here more than in any other spot in
Italy; <span class="tei tei-q">“until he has spent half an hour in Pozzuoli,”</span>
says the author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dolce Napoli</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“let no man say that
he understands the signification of the verb to pester.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Putting aside even the objectionable habits of so
many of its citizens, it cannot be said that the town
itself of Pozzuoli to-day is particularly attractive,
although its situation on the Bay of Baiae is charming
and its quays are full of picturesque life and movement.
Lines of irregular yellow-washed buildings,
with faded green <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">persiani</span></span> and balconies draped
with the domestic washing, with here and there a
domed rococo church, look down upon the clear
tide<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>less waters that gently lap the ancient stone-work of
the Mole, whilst a mixed crowd of fishermen with
bare bronzed limbs, of chattering women with gay
handkerchiefs tied over their thick black hair, and of
blue uniformed dapper little customs officers,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lupi
marini</span></span> (wolves of the sea) as the poor people facetiously
term these revenue officials of the coast—loiter
in the sunlight amidst the piles of tawny fishing nets
or the pyramids of golden oranges. From the quay
we make our way to the Largo del Municipio, a
typical square of a provincial town in the South,
enclosed by shabby houses and adorned by a couple
of stunted date-palms and a battered marble fountain,
around which numberless children and some slatternly
women noisily converse or dispute. There is an old
proverb in the South, that a good housewife has no
need to know any thoroughfares save those leading to
her church and her fountain, and as conversation cannot
well be carried on in the former, it is the daily
visits to the well that usually afford the required
opportunity for exchange of gossip or for the picking
of quarrels. Two statues decorate this unlovely but
not uninteresting space; one is that of a Spanish bishop,
Leon y Cardeñas, one of King Philip the Third’s
viceroys, which serves as a reminder of the many
vicissitudes this classic land has experienced in the
course of history:—Phoenician, Greek, Carthaginian,
Roman, Barbarian, Norman, German, French, Spanish
conquerors have all left <span class="tei tei-q">“footprints on the sands of
Time”</span> in the coveted land of the Siren, which all have
possessed in turn but none have held in perpetuity.
His Excellency the Bishop Cardeñas stands therefore
in the open as a solid memento of the glory that once
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was Spain, when half Europe and all America owned
the sway of the Catholic King. The second statue,
though not a thing of beauty, has always had the
attraction of an unsolved puzzle, for we cannot
decide whether it proves a complete absence or an
abundant superfluity of humour in the Puteolani of
to-day. It is the figure of a Roman senator, vested
in his flowing toga, and owning (as the ancient inscription
informs us) the grandiose name of Quintus Flavius
Mavortius Lollianus, whose marble trunk was one of
the earliest archaeological <span class="tei tei-q">“finds”</span> made in the
excavations at Pozzuoli some two hundred years ago.
Since the statue lacked a head and was otherwise of
no especial value as a work of art, the Viceroy of
Naples very generously presented this object to the
place of its discovery, whose citizens, doubtless
thinking the appearance of the headless statue uncanny,
popped a stray antique occiput (of which a goodly
number, more or less mutilated, are constantly brought
to light by the peasants) upon Lollianus’ vacant
shoulders. Anything more comical and at the same
time more repellent than this hybrid statue it would be
impossible to imagine, yet Lollianus of the unknown
head remains a favourite with the people of Pozzuoli.
Leaving the Largo del Municipio, with its weird senator
and its dusty palms, we ascend by a zigzag lane
between tall featureless houses to the Cathedral of
San Proculo, which occupies the site of a temple of
Augustus, that once dominated the ancient city and
harbour below. Within, the cathedral of Proculus,
who was a companion of St Januarius and a fellow-martyr,
is gaudy and painted, one of those dismally
gorgeous ecclesiastical interiors that are such a
dis<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>appointment to the antiquarian in Southern Italy. In
opposition to the memorial of Spanish conquest in
the square below, we find here an elaborate monument
to a French viceroy, the Duke of Montpensier, who
served for some time as Governor of Naples after
Charles VIII.’s capture of the city. Except the tomb
of the young musician Pergolese, who composed the
original <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stabat Mater</span></span> there is little else to see, and we
gladly ascend the tower in order to gain a bird’s eye
view of the town from a point of vantage whither
noisy coachmen, troublesome beggars and impudent
ragamuffins cannot pursue. Captured by the Greek
colonists of Cumae, who gave the city the name of
Dicoearchia instead of its ancient one of Puteoli,—a
corruption, perhaps, of the Syriac word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">petuli</span></span> (contention)—this
old Hellenic settlement was rechristened
Puteoli by the conquering Romans, under whose
beneficent rule the place rapidly aspired to wealth and
prosperity. With the rise however of Naples, the
fame of Puteoli began to grow dim, and its importance
to decline, although throughout Imperial times it ranked
after Ostia as the chief victualling port of Rome. And
of the two celebrated cities which adorned the shores
of this Bay in classical times, Puteoli was the seat of
commerce, and Baiae the resort of pleasure and luxury;
yet both were doomed to dwindle and almost perish in
the disastrous years that followed the break-up of the
Empire. The invading hordes of Germany, the raids
of Saracen pirates, and the constant presence of
malaria on this deserted coast were sufficient causes in
themselves to reduce in the course of time the thriving
port of Puteoli to the squalid town of to-day. From
our lofty post we can easily distinguish the limits of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the city in the days of Tiberius and Caligula, for to
the north we turn our faces towards the ruined bulk
of the Amphitheatre, now lying amidst fields and
gardens, but well within the town walls at the time
when Nero entertained the Armenian king Tiridates
and shocked his Asiatic guest by himself descending
into the arena and deftly performing the usual disgusting
feats of a professional gladiator. To westward
lies the Bay of Baiae, a semi-circle of glittering water
surrounded by low hills amidst which the Monte
Nuovo, unknown to the ancients, stands conspicuous.
How completely have all traces of splendour and
extravagance disappeared from these shores! At
fashionable Baiae across the Bay there is nothing visible
save a few shapeless ruins over the identity of which
scholars dispute; at busy Puteoli there survive to-day
but the ruined Amphitheatre, the Temple of Serapis,
and the arches of the famous Mole, to prove to
wondering posterity how great were the wealth, the
population and the magnificence of a spot which is
closely associated with all the power and culture of
the Roman Empire in its zenith.

Of the various fragments of antiquity that are still
standing in this district of the Phlegrean Fields, the
Mole of Puteoli is undoubtedly the best preserved and
the most interesting. So splendidly constructed is
this relic of the past, that but for continuous shocks of
earthquake the whole breakwater must have survived
intact; as it is, more than half the Mole has withstood
the wear and tear of centuries of wind and storm. It
is built on the model of a Greek pier, a series of arches
of massive masonry, acting at once as a barrier against
the force of the invading waves and as a means of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>preventing the silting of the sand. Formed of brick,
faced with stone, and cemented with the local volcanic
sand, which is consequently known as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">puzzolana</span></span>, this
wonderful breakwater must originally have stretched
out into the Bay a total length of twenty-five arches,
its furthest extremity being crowned by a light-house.
If we could only call up in imagination the Bay of
Baiae in the days of the Empire, when its shores were
fringed by sumptuous villas of famous or infamous
Romans and its expanse was thickly covered with
every variety of vessel of pleasure or merchandise,
instead of the few fishing boats that now and again
flit across its glassy surface, we might better be able
to realise the extraordinary episode which is connected
with this classical fragment in the little port of
Pozzuoli below us. For it was from the Mole of
Puteoli to the spit of land we see on the western
shore opposite that the demented tyrant, Caius Caligula,
constructed his historic bridge of boats across the
Baiaean gulf. Every large vessel in the surrounding
harbours had been pressed into the service of the
Emperor for this gigantic piece of folly, so that the
inhabitants of Rome were seriously inconvenienced by
the detention of their corn ships, and loud in consequence
were the complaints of the Roman populace,
for whose anger, it is needless to state, the Emperor
cared not a fig. <span class="tei tei-q">“History,”</span> says Gibbon, <span class="tei tei-q">“is but a
record of the crimes, follies and misfortunes of mankind;”</span>
and this smiling Bay of Baiae will ever be
memorable as the scene of what was perhaps the worst
exhibition of tyrannical caprice that the world has yet
witnessed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Using a double line of vessels well yoked
to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gether as a compact and solid base, the Emperor
now gave orders for a military road of the usual
Roman type to be constructed of planks of timber
covered with earth and paved with hewn stones.
When this stupendous work was completed, the usual
station-houses were erected at various intervals, and
fresh water was laid on by means of pipes connected
with the Imperial cisterns at Misenum. Upon this
broad road, laid across the Baiaean Gulf, the young
Emperor now advanced on horseback, followed by his
whole army clad in array of battle. Caligula on this
occasion wore a historic coat of armour studded with
rare gems that had once belonged to Alexander the
Great; a jewelled sword was fastened to his thigh,
and a crown of oak leaves bound his temples.
Solemnly the Emperor and his army crossed the
broad expanse of water on dry land and entered
Puteoli with mock honours of war. After remaining
a day in the port to refresh his victorious troops, the
Emperor was driven back in a splendidly equipped
chariot, which was surrounded by a number of
pretended captives of rank, some noble Parthian
hostages being utilised for the occasion. At the
centre of the bridge the procession halted, and the
crazy prince next indulged in an absurd bombastic
harangue, wherein he congratulated his soldiers on
their glorious campaign just concluded, and declared
to them that the famous feats of Xerxes and Darius
had at length been surpassed. Finally, he invited his
troops to a magnificent banquet upon this bridge of
boats, an entertainment which lasted till far into the
night and was accompanied by lavish illuminations by
land and sea. As might only have been expected,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg 311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the feast soon degenerated into a drunken orgy,
wherein every guest from the Master of the Roman
world to his meanest soldier became intoxicated,
whilst many persons in their cups lost their balance
and fell into the waters, so that the sounds of music and
revelry throughout the midnight hours were mingled
with groans and cries of drowning men close at hand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Apart from its senseless extravagance and innate
folly, the story of the bridging of the Baiaean Gulf, of
this harnessing of old Ocean, affects us moderns with
astonishment at the extraordinary thoroughness of all
the ancient Roman feats of engineering; had this
high road across the Bay been intended to serve any
useful purpose, instead of merely to satisfy the passing
whim of a selfish tyrant, we could have had no choice
but to admire the marvellous speed of the artificers
and the completeness of the scheme undertaken.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Quarter of a century later, and the Mole of Puteoli
was destined to become the scene of another event in
the world’s history, which has left a far more enduring
impression on mankind than the so-called miracle of
Caligula. In the early spring of the year 62 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%">A.D.</span></span>
there dropped anchor in the port a certain Alexandrian
corn-ship, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Castor </span><a name="corr311" id="corr311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr"><span style="font-style: italic">and</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> Pollux</span></span>, coming from Malta
after touching at Syracuse and Rhegium (Reggio) on
her way northward. Unnoticed amidst the vast
phalanx of shipping that lined the Mole and filled the
broad harbour of Puteoli, the vessel emptied her cargo
on the quay, whilst there also disembarked from her
hold a number of prisoners of no great social consequence,
who were on their way to Rome under the
guardianship of a kindly old centurion, named Julius,
belonging to the cohort <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Prima Augusta Italica</span></span>.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Amongst the persons under Julius’ charge was a Jew
named Paul, who was accompanied by three of his
friends, Timothy, Luke and Aristarchus of Thessalonica,
and all four, thanks to the kindness of the centurion,
who was evidently much attached to his exemplary
captive, were permitted to remain at this spot for seven
days. Paul himself was anxious to tarry at this spot,
for of all the Italian ports Puteoli was most frequented
by men of his own nation, so that the city possessed
its little community of Christians, who naturally were
eager to detain the Apostle. So hopelessly intermingled
are truth, tradition and legend concerning the
various places on Italian soil that St Paul is known to
have visited, that we cannot be too grateful for the
undoubted link with his journey to Rome that we
possess in the existing Mole of Puteoli, whose surface
has undoubtedly been trodden by the sandalled feet of
the great Apostle of the West. Here Paul landed
amid the haughty scenes of Roman pride and power;
above him he saw the pagan Temple of Augustus, all
gleaming with marble and gilded bronze that were
mirrored in the calm waters of the port: along this
famous causeway he passed, unmarked by the busy
crowd, except perhaps to be mocked by some idler for
his nationality or his halting speech. Guided by
Christian compatriots, the Apostle with his three faithful
friends was led through the noisy jostling concourse
of all countries that thronged the great Roman city to
the humble dwelling of his host. Where he lodged in
that mighty city we know not, but we do know for a
certain fact that he landed on the Mole, and that he
passed along it to the shore; it is not much, perhaps,
but that little is very precious.

What a contrast do these two incidents connected
with the Mole of Puteoli afford! The Roman
Emperor, glittering like the morning star in purple
mantle and jewelled cuirass, riding on his charger
across the solid road that to humour his own caprice
had been flung across the buoyant waters, accompanied
by soldiery, by music, and by bands of wealthy sycophants;
and the Apostle, poor, in bonds, a despised
prisoner in an alien land, meekly threading his way
through the crowds towards his mean lodging. Where
is the proud Temple of Augustus that beheld these two
strange scenes, that occurred with no great interval of
time apart? Where are the villas and quays that
lined the Bay of Baiae? The very ruins of the palaces
and warehouses are swept away; the gorgeous temple
is a Christian Cathedral dedicated to a follower of the
despised Jewish captive; the name of Caligula lives
but in human execration, whilst that of the Apostle is
enshrined in the hearts of the whole Christian world.

It is but a three-mile walk along the beach from
Pozzuoli to Baiae, passing beside the Lucrine Lake and
the southern slope of the Monte Nuovo, which always
seems to us a far more wonderful freak of Nature than
the Solfatara. Here we have a miniature mountain, a
mile and a half round its base and nearly five hundred
feet high, that was made in the course of a single night,
and is to-day less than four hundred years old! The
presence of this brand-new intruder on the shore of the
Baiaean Gulf must ever remain a wholesome warning to
all dwellers on these coasts, that their tenure of King
Pluto’s dominions is very insecure. One morning
towards the close of September 1538, after some days
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of earthquake shocks, <span class="tei tei-q">“Pozzuoli awoke,”</span> says the
flippant Alexandre Dumas, <span class="tei tei-q">“and on looking about
did not recognise herself! She had left a lake the
evening before, and lo! she found a mountain; where
she had owned a forest, she found ashes; and last
of all, where she had left a village, she perceived no
trace!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In one sense Dumas’ facetious description is correct:
the New Mountain was born with extraordinary celerity,
and woods, lake and village—familiar and beloved landmarks
to the people of Baiae and Pozzuoli—disappeared
at its birth. But the event was no peaceful act of
Nature; on the contrary, it was accompanied by loud
rumblings, by showers of red-hot stones, by clouds of
smoke, by torrents of scalding water, and by the retreating
of the sea, which left thousands of fish lying helpless
on the exposed shore. The village of Tripergola, a
summer pleasaunce of the Angevin kings of Naples,
and many traces of ancient Roman villas and engineering
works, all perished in this notable cataclysm.
Four eye-witnesses have left us details of this strange
scene of desolation, whilst only a few days after Mother
Earth had brought forth this new mountain, one of
them, the Spanish Viceroy of Naples, the valiant Don
Pedro of Toledo, owned sufficient pluck and curiosity
to make the ascent of the Monte Nuovo, still smoking
hot and reeking of sulphur. Who can tell when this
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">parvenu</span></span> volcano may spout forth fire and ashes? Would
any sane person have the courage ever to settle within
range of a possible eruption? No, the Phlegrean fields
are interesting to visit, but he must require a strong
nerve who would fain dwell beneath the shadow of this
dormant crater.

It is a very short walk from the base of the Monte
Nuovo to the <span class="tei tei-q">“golden shores”</span> of Imperial Baiae, which
is certainly not an imposing place in these days.
What with the destroying hand of time and the still
more obliterating action of the neighbouring volcano,
there is little left for the fancy to build upon; certainly
the three ruined shells that are called temples by
courtesy, but served probably a much humbler purpose
than that of worship, are not particularly striking. It
requires not only a good classical knowledge, but also
no small amount of imagination to picture the Baiae of
the Roman poets.

<span class="tei tei-q">“If Pozzuoli has gone down in the world, still more
so Baiae. It does not require any more sinking; it is
low enough as it is, so low that some of its ancient villas
and palaces can only be visited in a diving-bell. So
dreary and deserted is the site, that at first glance the
visitor feels mightily inclined to question the veracity
of the historian, and to doubt whether Baiae—Baiae
the gay, the fashionable, the dissolute, the beloved of
emperors, statesmen and poets—ever existed. But
when he is shown the enormous sub-structures lying
under water, and the masses of solid masonry wherewith
the surrounding hills are over-spread, incredulity gives
place to amazement. What towns of lath and plaster
are Brighton, Newport and Trouville, when compared
with this <span class="tei tei-q">‘Rome by the sea,’</span> where the materials used
for the foundations of a single villa would more than
suffice for the construction of a dozen <span class="tei tei-q">‘genteel marine
residences’</span> of the modern style! What would a
Roman architect think of the card-board streets and
squares, and the stucco crescents and terraces, of an
English watering-place? of those <span class="tei tei-q">‘eligible family

Here on this desolate strip of sea-shore, now
dominated by the Spanish viceroy’s frowning fortress
on the hill above, the great and opulent of ancient
Rome founded a city composed wholly of palaces.
Here were no noisy market-places to annoy aristocratic
nerves; no slums to afflict plutocratic nostrils;
no families of the proletariat to disturb the refined
senses of the jaded pleasure-seekers who retired hither
in the winter months. A writer, from whom we have
just quoted, makes comparison between Baiae and
Brighton or Trouville; but in reality the fashionable
American resort of Newport has more in common
with the old classical watering-place than any modern
European sea-side resort. The hot sulphur baths on
the Lucrine shore formed of course only a shallow
excuse for the annual migration of Roman fashionables
to Baiae, where blue-blooded senators and
pushing plutocrats indulged in fierce social struggles
for individual pre-eminence. Yet certain of the
natural warm springs had been enclosed in splendid
buildings, and were used by the luxurious citizens, so
that even to-day the Thermae of Nero (Stufe di
Nerone) are pointed out by the local guides. <span class="tei tei-q">“Quid
Nerone pejus? Quid thermis melius Neronianis?”</span>
(what is worse than Nero? yet what more beneficent
than his baths?) asks the poet Martial, whose name
will ever be bound up with the tales of luxury and
vice that are associated with this spot. Baiae in
winter, Tibur (Tivoli) in summer, the two names stand
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for the beau-ideal of a Roman existence, the cynosure
of every wealthy citizen.

But let us ascend out of the close and enervating air
of low-lying Baiae to the breezy heights of Misenum,
which has immortalised the name of the Trojan
trumpeter whose end was mourned by the tears of
pious Aeneas himself. In gaining its summit and in
gazing upon the landscape spread around us, we have
penetrated, so it seems, into the very heart of Italy:
not the Italy of Roman history, but the land of
Ausonia itself, the fabled shore that the Trojan hero
sailed at his goddess-mother’s bidding to discover,
when all the world was young and the high dwellers
of Olympus still condescended to take a personal
interest in the affairs of favourite mortals. Surely
the vine-clad terraces of Lake Avernus, the pools of
the Lucrine and the Mare Morto, the verdure-clad
hillocks lying beneath us must conceal the true secret
of the antique Tyrrhenian country, in whose history
the rise and fall of Roman power afford but one
amongst many epochs. Looking to northward,
beyond the little landing-stage of Torregaveta, we
behold the heights of Cumae, that was a flourishing
city with harbour and citadel hundreds of years before
a certain Romulus built a wall of mud near the banks
of Tiber and slew his brother Remus for leaping over
his handiwork. The founding of Rome is enveloped
in impenetrable clouds of legend; the building of
Cumae is a fact:—here then we obtain a key to
Italian history. Rome, whose origin is lost in mists
of obscurity, is a flourishing modern capital; Cumae
is but a shapeless mass of crumbling ruins, overgrown
with ivy and cytizus, and inhabited by lizards and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>serpents. But both cities, dead Cumae and living
Rome, present but passing events in the long slow
progress of the centuries, which have witnessed successive
phases of civilisation and destruction in this

Is the Genius of Italy, the Sibyl of Cumae, still
living, we wonder, in some dim recess, some secret
cavern of Cimmerian gloom, beneath those decaying
heaps of the ancient Greek city? She was old, very
old, we know, when pious Aeneas found her shrieking
her strange prophecies, and that was long ages before
Hellenic wanderers raised a fortress upon the wooded
heights above the dread lake of Avernus.—Venerable
Mother of Italy! dost thou still survive muttering thy
strange warnings in some sunless labyrinth, that the
rapacious guides of Baiae have yet failed to penetrate?
Art thou, like King Arthur of romantic Wales, still
keeping watch over the destiny of thy country, ever

            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state

            have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
            against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
            approach us with offers to donate.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and

            originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file
